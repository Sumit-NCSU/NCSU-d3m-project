week of March), Sen. Pia Cayetano said a bill is now being pushed to eventually
mandate the government to assist individuals with rare disease by means of
increasing their access to medical treatment and drugs, and include them in the
coverage of the Universal Health Care program.

National Organization for Rare Disorders Awards Grant to Support Research in
Stiff-Person Syndrome

DATELINE: Karachi


Karachi, Jan. 14 -- The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) has
awarded a research grant for the study of stiff-person syndrome, a rare acquired
neurological disorder,1 to Eric Lancaster, MD, PhD of the University of
Pennsylvania.
Specifically, Lundbeck conducted a web-based campaign,
"Raise Your Hand to Fight Rare Diseases," an initiative for Rare Disease Day
2010 that led the company to donate $10,000 to NORD's general research fund.
NORD was my first contact.
I am encouraged to
know that there are scientists who are interested in this very rare disease and
that NORD is able to fund the research."
"There has been limited research on stiff-person syndrome so we were quite
pleased when our medical advisory committee granted Dr. Lancaster the award,"
said Peter L. Saltonstall, NORD president and CEO.
To
the horror of his father and friend who were sitting - hanging on - in the back,
James was allowed to take full control at 40mph.
No special measures have been
implemented, even for the detection of rare diseases," says Lam Ching-wan,
clinical professor at the Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing (LKS) Faculty of
Medicine at the University of Hong Kong.

The last day of February is marked as International Rare Diseases Day.
The Hong
Kong Alliance for Rare Diseases was established on that day this year, with a
mission to urge the government to protect the human rights of this largely

AGOO, La Union: Rep. Eufranio Eriguel (La Union, 2nd District) said that the
Congress has approved the Rare Disease Bill which provides medical and financial
support to patients with uncommon diseases in the country.
There are too many rare diseases to test for - to try to
rule out the possibility of rare diseases, a person would have to undergo whole
genome sequencing which is very expensive.
The BeHEARD challenge helps
non-profits, academics, advocacy groups, families of patients and for-profit
companies to collaborate in their collective mission to advance rare disease
research.
Working with ethics
committees, patient advocacy, support groups and patients' families, Actelion
has extended the study on Eisenmenger syndrome to Down syndrome patients, which
will help to address the high unmet medical need for effective, targeted PAH
therapies in this vulnerable and too rarely considered population.
Newcastle's position as a world leader - following groundbreaking research on
new genetic treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy - has seen it handed
control of the £32m EU programme.

* GATTEX/REVESTIVE (teduglutide [rDNA origin]) with growing sales for the
treatment of adults with SBS, a rare GI condition

* NATPARA/NATPAR (rhPTH [1-84]), if approved, would be the only bioengineered
hormone replacement therapy for use in the treatment of HPT, a rare endocrine
disease

* Shire expects transaction to be accretive to Non GAAP EPS from 2016 onward

* Acquisition to be effected by a tender offer and funded from Shire's cash
resources, as well as existing and new bank facilitie

With our global strength and
expertise in both rare diseases and GI, Shire is uniquely positioned to drive
the continued success of GATTEX/REVESTIVE, and, if approved, commercialize NPS
Pharma's pipeline compound NATPARA/NATPAR.
Information on GATTEX/REVESTIVE

In the United States, GATTEX (teduglutide [rDNA origin]) for injection is
approved  for the long-term treatment of adults with short bowel syndrome (SBS)
who need parenteral support.
GATTEX is the first analog of GLP-2 approved to
treat SBS, a disease which may require patients to get their nutrition
intravenously through a central line.
[2]

GATTEX has received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and was approved in December 2012.
Information on NATPARA/NATPAR

NATPARA/NATPAR, NPS Pharma's parathyroid hormone (rhPTH [1-84]) for the
treatment of hypoparathyroidism (HPT), a rare endocrine disorder characterized
by insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), is currently under review
in the U.S. with an FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for
the Biologics License Application (BLA) on January 24, 2015.
In the absence of an approved parathyroid replacement
therapy, the standard approach focuses on using large doses of calcium and
active vitamin D to increase calcium levels in the blood and reduce the severity
of symptoms.
There is no approved therapy for this ultra-rare, life-long genetic
disorder that affects both adults and children.
Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and Slaughter & May

Information on GATTEX/REVESTIVE

In the United States, GATTEX (teduglutide [rDNA origin]) for injection is
approved  for the long-term treatment of adults with short bowel syndrome (SBS)
who need parenteral support.
GATTEX is the first analog of GLP-2 approved to
treat SBS, a disease which may require patients to get their nutrition
intravenously through a central line.
In the U.S., approximately 6,000-7,000 SBS patients are dependent on parenteral
support with a similar prevalence in Europe.2

GATTEX has received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and was approved in December 2012.
Information on NATPARA/NATPAR

NATPARA/NATPAR, NPS Pharma's parathyroid hormone (rhPTH -83) for the treatment
of hypoparathyroidism (HPT), a rare endocrine disorder characterized by
insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), is currently under review in
the U.S. with an FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for the
Biologics License Application (BLA) on January 24, 2015.
In the absence of an approved parathyroid replacement
therapy, the standard approach focuses on using large doses of calcium and
active vitamin D to increase calcium levels in the blood and reduce the severity
of symptoms.
There is no approved therapy for this ultra-rare, life-long genetic disorder
that affects both adults and children.

IN OCTOBER 2012, 41-year-old Joselyn Taruc finally learned that her 2-year-old
daughter Queen Zina is afflicted with Hurler Syndrome, a rare and progressive
genetic disorder that causes her to develop a large head, dark skin, coarse
facial features (bulging forehead, depressed nasal bridge, broad mouth, square
jaw), short neck, enlarged abdomen, clawed hands, crouched stance and to suffer
from vision impairment, hearing loss and stunted growth.
GAGs also help with many other cellular functions,
including growth control, organ development and signaling between cells.
"I'm not going to stop after the vote," he added

A motion passed by Queen's Park would provide an agreed intention for the
province's legislature, rather than a bill which creates a new law.

cost-effective way to treat children with growth hormone deficiency."

NPS Pharmaceuticals Observes Rare Disease Day 2012

LENGTH: 955  words


New Delhi, March 3 -- NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: NPSP), a specialty
pharmaceutical company developing orphan therapeutics for rare gastrointestinal
and endocrine disorders, is joining the National Organization for Rare Disorders
(NORD) and other organizations around the world today to observe World Rare
Disease Day on February 29, 2012.
While
nearly one in 10 Americans lives with a rare disease, only about 200 of the
diseases classified as rare have FDA-approved treatments.
"Everyone knows someone with a rare disease but many don't appreciate the
support these patients need," said Peter L. Saltonstall, president and CEO of
NORD.
NORD is the sponsor
in the U.S.

On Rare Disease Day 2012, activities in the U.S. will include a "Handprints
Across America" campaign to create a gallery of photos on the Rare Disease Day
website; educational materials for classroom teachers; and a nationwide blitz of
patient photos, stories and videos to increase awareness of specific rare
diseases and the challenges of living with a rare disease.
In addition, several
special events are planned, including a scientific symposium at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and a Rare Disease Patient Advocacy Day in
conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In the U.S., the coalition supporting Rare Disease Day includes patient
organizations and advocacy groups, medical professionals and associations,
government agencies, researchers, and companies developing treatments for rare
diseases.
More than 500 patient organizations, government entities, research
institutions, and companies developing treatments have signed up as Rare Disease
Day Partners on the national website hosted by NORD (www.rarediseaseday.us).
About Hypoparathyroidism

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder in which the body produces insufficient
levels of parathyroid hormone, the principal regulator of calcium and
phosphorus.
There is no approved hormone
replacement for hypoparathyroidism.
He writes letters to local lawmakers every year, asking them to make
August Stevens-Johnson Syndrome awareness month.
The
disease affects the entire immune system and cannot be cured but can be
controlled with medicines, doctors said.Due to lack of awareness, patients
suffering from either type are mostly put on psychiatric medicines say experts.
"With diagnosis being difficult and the need to rule out all other tissue
diseases, by the time patients are referred to a rheumatologist, they are
already on psychiatric medicines.
According to a letter from Janie Phillips, her brother-in-law, David Phillips,

was paralyzed and on a ventilator.

Alexion Joins Eurordis, NORD and Patient Organizations Worldwide in Celebrating
Rare Disease Day 2013

LENGTH: 1842  words


New Delhi, March 2 -- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALXN), joins the
European Organization for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS), the National Organization
for Rare Disorders (NORD) and patient organizations worldwide in celebrating
Rare Disease Day 2013, a global effort to focus attention on rare diseases,
their profound impact on patients, and the need for improved diagnosis and
treatment.
Few physicians are familiar with
diagnosing and treating these illnesses, which frequently leads to missed,
delayed or inaccurate diagnoses even when an approved, effective therapy is
available.1 Because of this, it is important to educate the medical community
through disease awareness programs and diagnostic initiatives to identify
patients suffering from rare and ultra-rare diseases as early as possible.
Alexion developed Soliris (eculizumab), a first-in-class terminal complement
inhibitor, from the laboratory through regulatory approval and
commercialization.
Soliris is approved in the US, European Union, Japan and
other countries as the first and only treatment for patients with paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a debilitating, life-threatening and ultra-rare
blood disorder.
Soliris is also approved in the US and the European Union as the
first and only treatment for patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome
(aHUS), a debilitating and life-threatening ultra-rare genetic disorder.
About aHUS

aHUS is a chronic, ultra-rare, and life-threatening disease in which a genetic
deficiency in one or more complement regulatory genes causes chronic
uncontrolled complement activation, resulting in complement-mediated thrombotic
microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels
throughout the body.5,6 Permanent, uncontrolled complement activation in aHUS
causes a life-long risk for TMA, which leads to sudden, catastrophic, and
life-threatening damage to the kidney, brain, heart, and other vital organs, and
premature death.5,7 Sixty-five percent of all patients with aHUS require kidney
dialysis, have permanent kidney damage or die within the first year after
diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI).8,9 The majority of
patients with aHUS who receive a kidney transplant commonly experience
subsequent systemic TMA, resulting in a 90% transplant failure rate in these TMA
patients.10

aHUS affects both children and adults.11 Complement-mediated TMA also causes
reduction in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and red blood cell destruction
(hemolysis).
While mutations have been identified in at least ten different
complement regulatory genes, mutations are not identified in 30-50% of patients
with a confirmed diagnosis of aHUS.11

About PNH

PNH is an ultra-rare blood disorder in which chronic, uncontrolled activation of
complement, a component of the normal immune system, results in hemolysis
(destruction of the patient's red blood cells).
PNH often goes unrecognized, with delays in diagnosis ranging from one to
more than 10 years.14 In the period of time before Soliris was available, it had
been estimated that approximately one-third of patients with PNH did not survive
more than five years from the time of diagnosis.12 PNH has been identified more
commonly among patients with disorders of the bone marrow, including aplastic
anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).15-17 In patients with
thrombosis of unknown origin, PNH may be an underlying cause.12

About Soliris

Soliris is a first-in-class terminal complement inhibitor developed from the
laboratory through regulatory approval and commercialization by Alexion.
Soliris
is approved in the U.S., European Union, Japan and other countries as the first
and only treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH),
a debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening blood disorder, characterized by
complement-mediated hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells).
Soliris is also approved in the U.S. and the European Union as the first and
only treatment for patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a
debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by
complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA (blood clots in small
vessels).
Soliris is available only through a restricted program
under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).
WAâ[#x20ac][TM]s new rare diseases strategy â[#x20ac]" a first in the nation
â[#x20ac]" outlines measures to improve the lives of people with rare diseases
in the State by diagnosing more and sooner, so those people can be cared for
better and treated where possible.
â[#x20ac]oeI found that very frustrating because as a mum or dad you
donâ[#x20ac][TM]t have control.
â[#x20ac]oeYou just feel like youâ[#x20ac][TM]ve got a bit of control and you
can make a difference in their life.
The policy
saw the light of day after multiple representations to the Central Government
and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare were made since 2009 by lawyers
and organisations working for the treatment of rare diseases.
Delhi High court orders in three writ petitions in 2013 and 2016, advocated by
lawyer Ashok Aggarwal, had directed the Health Ministry to frame a national
policy for rare diseases.
The measure would create an Office of Rare Diseases in the Department of Health,
encourage research and development, and provide for fiscal and regulatory
incentives for the manufacture and importation of treatments for rare disorders.
Already approved by Congress, the bill is now awaiting the signature of
President Aquino.
We hope President Aquino will sign it into law and not veto it, Magdaraog said.
This method of diagnosing, Dr Hamzeh said, made it difficult to apply preventive
measures, early detection and treatment.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
there are nearly 7,000 such rare diseases and an estimated 95% do not have a
single approved drug treatment.
Weber also outlined plans for commercialization of the drug, and explained how
approval of sarizotan could make the company very commercially attractive and
supply it with a desirable US FDA priority review voucher.
The company's CEO is confident the Phase III study will yield positive results
and he highlighted that after discussions with regulators, Newron has recently
added younger patients into the trial.
Newron submitted results from juvenile toxicology
studies to the FDA for the amendment of the STARS trial.
Weber noted that "the
inclusion of the younger patients in the study, and assurance from the FDA that
we should get a label for the complete population, means there is huge promise
that this drug might not only improve the duration of apnea but also, to a
certain extent, slow down damage to the brain."
Italy-based Newron expects to market sarizotan itself in the US and Europe, if
the drug is approved by regulatory authorities.
PRV Potential

If sarizotan is approved in the US for Rett syndrome in all age groups, Newron
will be eligible for a priority review voucher as the product would be indicated
for a pediatric rare disease.
Weber noted Newron could use a voucher to speed up
regulatory proceedings for its other clinical-stage compound evenamide, which is
in Phase II development as an add-on treatment for patients with schizophrenia
that are resistant to prescribed therapies.
"When sarizotan comes up for review and is hopefully approved, we should get a
voucher that could be used to get a nice cash payment," Weber said.
Approximately 10 rare pediatric disease vouchers have been granted so far by the
FDA, many of these are yet to be redeemed.
M&A Opportunity

An approved rare disease therapy in a vacant market and an unused PRV would be
likely to put the spotlight on Newron as a potential biotech takeover target in
2018.
Little Rivalry In Rett Syndrome

There are no approved treatments for Rett syndrome and Weber highlighted that
Newron is the first company to run a pivotal study in this disease; "no one else
has made it to this stage," he said.
If sarizotan is successfully approved by regulators the drug will enter a vacant
market with huge unmet need, despite the number of patients in this rare disease
setting being limited.

HERCULANEUM FAMILY WILL SPEAK TO FDA ABOUT RARE DISEASE

BYLINE: Tim Rowden Of The Post-Dispatch

SECTION: JEFFERSON COUNTY POST; Pg.
Two years ago, Sean began an experimental treatment protocol aimed at
controlling the symptoms and halting the progress of the disease.
"That's one of the reasons we want to get this drug approved so we can get Cody
treated," Eric Merrell says.
The family will have five minutes to make the case Wednesday before an FDA
advisory committee that is reviewing the research on Aldurazyme.
Although the FDA doesn't have to follow the committee's recommendations, the
hearing is "a major hurdle" toward getting the treatment approved, says Abbey
Meyers, president of the organization for rare disorders.
Meyers said the FDA was expected to make a decision by this spring.
The FDA approved 33 new medicines for rare diseases in 2013.
The family has also begun selling rare disease ribbons in partnership with
Global Genes, a patient advocacy group that raises awareness for rare diseases
through the symbol of hope.
''I have gone from having a wonderful life and being in control to being totally

He explains: "I had stopped look-look ing after myself and had let things get

"With this latest financing, Acer is well-positioned to progress our late-stage
therapeutic candidates for serious rare diseases, particularly as we rapidly
advance our lead candidate ACER-002 for vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome toward
key regulatory milestones," said Chris Schelling, CEO and founder of Acer.
Both ACER-002 and ACER-001 received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), which is provided to drugs and biologics that are
defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or
prevention of rare diseases and disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people
in the U.S.

About ACER-002 and Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS)

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of hereditary disorders of connective
tissue.
There are currently no
FDA-approved therapies for vEDS.1

Acer is advancing ACER-002 (celiprolol), a new chemical entity (NCE), for the
treatment of vEDS and plans to file an NDA based on a randomized controlled
clinical study of celiprolol.2 In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) granted ACER-002 orphan drug designation for the potential treatment of
vEDS.
There is no FDA-approved therapy for MSUD, and the
condition is sub-optimally managed by a highly-restricted diet alone.
In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
granted ACER-001 orphan drug designation for the potential treatment of MSUD.
Like private donors, government agencies have traditionally dedicated most of
their money to brand-name illnesses with large advocacy groups, so part of the
role of the rare disease foundations is to pique the interest of elected
officials and scientists.
Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic, often fatal neurological illness that
causes loss of muscle control.
The government will typically respond to the concerns with measures that could
include a review or funding for a new drug, Harris said.

Auspex Pharmaceuticals Receives FDA Orphan Drug Designation of SD-809 for
Treatment of Tourette Syndrome in Pediatric Population

LENGTH: 333  words


Jan. 14 -- US-based Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. issued the following news
release:

Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ASPX), a biopharmaceutical company
dedicated to developing innovative medicines for people with movement disorders
and other rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to Auspex's
investigational compound SD-809 for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in the
pediatric population (defined as zero through 16 years of age).
In November 2014, SD-809 was granted orphan drug designation by the
FDA for the treatment of Huntington's disease.
The FDA's Orphan Drug program offers orphan status to drugs and biologics that
are intended for the treatment of rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000
people in the U.S.
The designation provides sponsors with development and
commercial incentives for designated compounds and medicines, including
eligibility for a seven-year period of market exclusivity in the U.S. after
product approval, FDA assistance in clinical trial design and an exemption from
FDA user fees.
If approved, Ilaris will be the first and only approved biologic treatment in
Europe for Tumor Necrosis Factor-Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS),
Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)/Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) and
Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).
Results showed rapid (at Day 15) and sustained
disease control with Ilaris compared to placebo through 16 weeks, in patients
with either TRAPS, HIDS/MKD or FMF[3].
In August 2016, the European Commission approved Ilaris for a license extension
to treat patients with Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD), a rare type of
inflammatory arthritis.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously
granted three simultaneous approvals of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS,
HIDS/MKD and FMF in September 2016.
Ilaris is currently approved and marketed for the treatment of Systemic Juvenile
Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) in the US and EU and for the treatment of AOSD and
the symptomatic treatment of refractory acute gouty arthritis in the EU.
Ilaris
is also approved in more than 70 countries, including in the EU, Switzerland,
US, Canada, and Japan for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic
Syndromes (CAPS): rare, lifelong, genetic disorders with debilitating symptoms.
In the EU, Ilaris is approved for following subtypes of CAPS: Muckle-Wells
syndrome (MWS), neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID)/chronic
infantile neurological, cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA), severe forms of
familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS)/familial cold urticaria (FCU)
presenting with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin rash.
The
approved indications may vary depending upon the individual country.
The government will typically respond to the concerns with measures that could
include a review or funding for a new drug, Harris said.
Health Minister Eric Hoskins said of about 23 applications for Soliris funding,
the province has approved 10 and is reviewing another three.
He applauded Harris for his advocacy on behalf of rare disease sufferers, but
wouldn't say yet if the Liberal government will support the motion.

Akari Therapeutics Announces Receipt of Orphan Drug Designation for Coversin
from US FDA for Treatment of Guillain Barre Syndrome

LENGTH: 360  words


May 12 -- Akari Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AKTX), an emerging growth,
development-stage biopharmaceutical company, announced today that the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted to Akari an Orphan Drug Designation
for recombinant protein inhibitor of compliment factor 5 for the treatment of
Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS).
The FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation status to products that treat rare
diseases, providing incentives to sponsors developing drugs or biologics.
The
FDA defines rare diseases as those affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the
United States at the time of designation.
Orphan Drug Designation provides the
sponsor certain benefits and incentives, including a period of marketing
exclusivity if regulatory approval of the drug is ultimately received for the
designated indication, potential tax credits for certain activities, eligibility
for orphan drug grants, and the waiver of certain administrative fees.
The
receipt of Orphan Drug Designation status does not change the regulatory
requirements or process for obtaining marketing approval and designation does
not mean that marketing approval will be received.
The government will typically respond to the concerns with measures that could
include a review or funding for a new drug, Harris said.
Health Minister Eric Hoskins said of about 23 applications for Soliris funding,
the province has approved 10 and is reviewing another three.
He applauded Harris for his advocacy on behalf of rare disease sufferers, but
wouldn't say yet if the Liberal government will support the motion.
The designation provides sponsors with
development and commercial incentives, including 10 years of market exclusivity,
prioritized consultation by the European Medicines Agency on the development of
the drug, including clinical studies, and certain exemptions from, or reductions
in, regulatory fees.
In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted orphan drug status
in the United States to Metadoxine for the treatment of Fragile X Syndrome, and
in 2015, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to our proprietary Metadoxine
Extended Release (MDX) for Fragile X Syndrome.
Currently, there are no approved
medications in the United States or Europe for Fragile X Syndrome.
This causes problems with swallowing, feeding, talking, dribbling and other
actions controlled by these muscles.
The primary outcome measures are the number of
reported adverse events and changes in parenteral and enteral support
requirements, respectively.
The study will attempt to enroll a fourth cohort of patients in an
observational arm that would receive a current standard of care with parenteral
support and will be considered a safety control group.
Whether a treatment is Nice approved or not, does not itself determine who
should have it on the NHS,' Ms Mordaunt said.
I have secured non-Nice approved drugs for other constituents and have also got
Nice guidelines changed.
This means all the arguments for a drug being Nice approved are not
taken into account.
This is an abuse of people's human rights.'
Her eight-year old son Isaac is living with Moebius Syndrome, an extremely rare
condition that affects muscles controlling facial expressions and eye-control.
The ability to link nationally and internationally has created some powerful,
political lobby groups such as NORD, the US National Organisation for Rare
Diseases.
However, 20 years ago many support groups in the US unified to create NORD.
According to the NORD website, in the decade
before the Orphan Drug Act was enacted, only 10 new treatments for orphan
diseases were developed.
In the 20 years since it was passed, more than 200 new treatments for rare
disorders have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and an
additional 900 are in various stages of development.
More recently NORD has been able to pressure US President George Bush to pass
legislation doubling the budget for research into rare diseases.
We
soon realised there was a lot of work to do, so we evolved into a foundation to
give the group more leverage for advocacy, lobbying, education and fundraising,"
Kathy Russell says.
The drug he did not qualify to receive years ago - idursulfase - has since been
approved by Health Canada to treat his disease, called Hunter syndrome.
Without a new standard, drugs for rare diseases are far less likely to be
approved for provincial government funding.
Paul McCabe, managing director for Canada of Shire Human Genetic Therapies Inc.
- the drug's manufacturer - said Elaprase is approved in about 30 countries.
"Many advocacy groups can help patients live a little better life," said Groft.

Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA Office of Orphan Products

condition affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S.
But health regulator NICE has indicated it may not recommend
the drug.
Additionally, ArQule received orphan drug designation from the Federal Drug
Administration (FDA) for ARQ 092 in Proteus syndrome.
This marks an important
regulatory milestone and the first orphan drug designation for this population.
"The collaboration with ArQule has provided an opportunity to initiate a phase 1
trial to investigate the therapeutic impact of ARQ 092 in a rare, genetic
disorder that has no approved therapy and for which the only current treatment
is surgery," said Dr. Leslie G. Biesecker, M.D., Chief of the Medical Genomics
and Metabolic Genetics Branch at the National Human Genome Research Institute.
It is hoped the drug, if shown to be
safe and effective and approved by the FDA to treat Proteus syndrome in the
future, could potentially be administered over many years in order to mitigate
the abnormal cell signaling initiated by the point mutation."
"Proteus syndrome is the first rare disease indication to
enter phase 1 for ARQ 092, and we are pleased to have received orphan drug
designation from the FDA.
The software measures

Ian's physician, Dr. Bradley Dixon of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
Center, described the disorder as the failure of one of the proteins in the
kidney to properly control how much chloride (salt) is being put in the urine.
"Chloride is very carefully controlled by the kidney, and if you don't have
enough chloride in your body, then other electrolyte disturbances can start to
develop," he said.

Pfizer said Tuesday that it had licensed the worldwide rights to a treatment for
Gaucher disease, a rare genetic disorder, from Protalix Biotherapeutics, an
Israeli biotechnology company.
Because of the
shortage, the Food and Drug Administration has been allowing some patients to
use the Shire and Protalix drugs even though they have not been approved.
Alien hand syndrome can occur when a person has had the two hemispheres of their
brain surgically separated to control epilepsy or it can be the result of a
stroke, infection or tumour.
When an
individual clicks the Raise Your Hand icon posted on the National Organization

Lundbeck will make an unrestricted donation to NORD's general research fund.
"There is limited funding available to support research on the nearly 7,000 rare
diseases affecting nearly 30 million Americans,"1 said Peter L. Saltonstall,
NORD president and CEO.
"Our continued partnership with NORD reflects our overall
efforts to push forward research and innovation that can have a positive impact
on patients, families and caregivers."
In the last three years, Lundbeck has introduced three therapies for rare
central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including ONFI (clobazam), which became
available in January and is approved as add-on treatment of seizures associated
with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) in people 2 years of age and older.
The purpose of the day is to raise awareness of rare
diseases as a public health issue and bring together patients and families with
rare diseases to discuss the need for greater awareness, more research, and
better access to diagnosis and treatment.1 Rare Disease Day was first launched
in 2008 in Europe by the European Rare Disease Organization, EURORDIS, a sister
organization to NORD.
In 2009, other countries throughout the world joined
EURODIS to observe the day.5 NORD, which represents the nearly 30 million
Americans affected by rare diseases,1 is the sponsor of Rare Disease Day in the
United States.
ONFI

ONFI
is a federally controlled substance (C-IV) because it can be abused or lead to

Abeona Therapeutics Announces FDA Allowance of Investigational New Drug (IND)
for Phase 1/2 Clinical Study with ABO-101 Gene Therapy for Patients With
Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B (MPS IIIB)

LENGTH: 1181  words


May 24 -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: ABEO), a clinical-stage
biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering gene therapy and plasma-based
products for severe and life-threatening rare diseases, today announced the FDA
has allowed an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for its Phase 1/2
Clinical Study with gene therapy candidate ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU) for patients with
Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB) to be conducted at Nationwide Children's
Hospital (Columbus, OH).
This is the second FDA allowance for a gene therapy
trial from Abeona this year, following allowance of an IND in February for
ABO-102, for patients with MPS IIIA which commenced with dosing of the first
cohort of patients this month.
"Abeona is committed to building a leadership position in the development of
innovative treatments for orphan diseases, and this second FDA IND allowance
represents an important milestone in advancing our rare disease product pipeline
to the clinic," stated Steven H. Rouhandeh, Executive Chairman of Abeona.
Information about a rare disease's natural
history aids in clinical trial design, identifying study end points and
developing and validating clinical outcome measures, and biomarkers.
A single dose of ABO-101 significantly restored normal
cell and organ function, corrected cognitive defects that remained months after
drug administration, increased neuromuscular control and increased the lifespan
of animals with MPS III over 100% one year after treatment compared to untreated
control animals.

Washington: FDA approves Vimizim to treat rare congenital enzyme disorder

LENGTH: 427  words

DATELINE: Washington


US Food and Drug Administration, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Vimizim (elosulfase alfa),
the first FDA-approved treatment for Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (Morquio A
syndrome).
An FDA priority review provides for an
expedited review of drugs for serious diseases or conditions that may offer
major advances in treatment.
"This approval and rare pediatric disease priority review voucher underscores
the agency's commitment to making treatments available to patients with rare
diseases," said Andrew E. Mulberg, M.D., deputy director, Division of
Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products in the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research (CDER).
"Prior to today's approval, patients with this
rare disease have had no approved drug treatment options."
Vimizim is being approved with a
boxed warning to include the risk of anaphylaxis.
But more than support from organizations and pharmaceutical companies, PSOD is
hoping a law would soon be passed here in the country to help patients with rare
diseases.
BioMarin have done their part,
and I would urge NICE and NHS England to approve a drug that clearly works and
is approved in other countries.
Recently he
also tabled a parliamentary motion saying that it is now 14 months since Vimizim
was approved on a European level and is already in use in 20 other countries on
the continent.
"I always found a way to get in," admits Aneeba, who is now a healthy weight
after she learned to control her eating.
"But when I hit 17 I realised I needed to control it.
This week, the boys will start an experimental drug protocol aimed at
controlling the symptoms and halting the progress of the disease.
Pastores said a report would be submitted to the FDA later this year.
The FDA
will have six months to take action.
Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome is usually
first seen in children aged between three and 15 and causes uncontrollable
seizures that can be resistant to medications and other treatments.
While the US, Europe, Japan, Singapore and Australia all have orphan disease
laws that give incentives to drug companies to finance research, treatments and
cures, Israel still does not have these laws.
Only about 30 people in the United Kingdom know that they have the syndrome,
which affects the kidneys and leads to a dangerously low level of potassium and
magnesium, the electrolytes that control the heart.

FDA Grants Soligenix Orphan Drug Designation for Dusquetide for Treatment of
Macrophage Activation Syndrome

LENGTH: 352  words


Aug. 18 -- Soligenix, Inc. (OTCQB: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a
late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing
products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced
today that the Office of Orphan Products Development of the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to the active
ingredient dusquetide for treatment of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).
Dusquetide is an innate defense regulator (IDR),
a new class of short, synthetic peptides that accelerates bacterial clearance
and resolution of tissue damage while modulating inflammation following exposure
to a variety of agents including bacterial pathogens, trauma, radiation and/or
chemotherapy.
In addition to providing a seven year term of market exclusivity upon final FDA
approval, orphan drug designation also positions Soligenix to be able to
leverage a wide range of financial and regulatory benefits, including government
grants for conducting clinical trials, waiver of expensive FDA user fees for the
potential submission of a New Drug Application, and certain tax credits.
"The FDA's decision to grant dusquetide orphan drug designation signifies an
important step for Soligenix as we continue to expand our biotherapeutics
pipeline and the many potential applications of our novel IDR technology,"
stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Soligenix.

(ODD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines
Agency (EMA) for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, including Usher syndrome
, the subtype targeted by QRX-411.
Securing orphan drug designations from the FDA and EMA for QRX-411 is
a milestone for the program and highlights the importance of addressing the
unmet need of this debilitating disease," said Daniel A. de Boer, CEO of ProQR,
"The severe genetic retinal diseases we are targeting do not have any available
therapies, especially disease modifying therapies focused on restoring vision or
impeding progression of the disease.
QR-110 was also granted Fast
Track designation by the FDA and Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and EMA.
To date, there are no treatments
approved or products in clinical development that treat the vision loss
associated with the disease.

Zogenix Receives Orphan Drug Designation from FDA for ZX008 in Treatment of
Lennox Gastaut Syndrome

LENGTH: 384  words


June 22 -- Zogenix, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZGNX), a pharmaceutical company developing
therapies for the treatment of orphan and central nervous system (CNS)
disorders, today announced the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has granted
its investigational drug, ZX008 (low-dose fenfluramine), orphan drug designation
for the treatment of Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), a refractory, debilitating
childhood-onset epilepsy.
The Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA follows the
European Union's granting of Orphan Drug Designation for ZX008 in the treatment
of LGS earlier this year.
"The
Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for our Phase 3 LGS study was
approved to proceed by the FDA in April.
Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development
grants Orphan Drug Designation to investigational drugs and biologics that are
intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000
people in the U.S. Orphan drug status is intended to facilitate drug development
for rare diseases and may provide several benefits to drug developers, including
assistance with clinical study design and drug development, tax credits for
qualified clinical trials costs, exemptions from certain FDA application fees,
and seven years of market exclusivity upon regulatory product approval.
He was the principal investigator in the clinical studies that led to the
approval of teduglutide (GattexÂ®), to date the only FDA-approved product for

Aug. 2 -- X4 Pharmaceuticals, a clinical stage biotechnology company developing
novel CXCR4 inhibitor drugs to improve immune cell trafficking to treat cancer
and rare diseases, today announced the initiation of a multi-year sponsored
research program with Yale University to develop and study a genetic model of
WHIM syndrome, a rare genetic immunodeficiency disease which currently has no
approved treatments.
There is no approved therapy for the treatment of WHIM syndrome.
Within the
bone marrow, a normally functioning CXCR4 receptor controls the release of
neutrophils and leukocytes into the blood stream, thereby ensuring normal immune
surveillance functions throughout the body.

About Proteus Syndrome

According to the patient advocacy and support group, the Proteus syndrome
Foundation (http://www.proteus-syndrome.org/), the condition was named for
Proteus, the Greek god who could transform his shape.
The incidence of Proteus syndrome classifies it
as a rare disorder, defined by the National Organization of Rare Diseases (NORD)
as any disease affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans.
Naglazyme, a synthetic enzyme
approved in the U.S. but not Canada, can help break down that cellular buildup.
With Aleena's funding approved, the Sadownyks' next learning curve will be tied
to her treatment.
In a scathing criticism, she branded the proposals an abuse of human rights'.
She added: This is an abuse of people's human rights.'
Four-year-old Trey suffers from Hunter syndrome, an extremely rare
enzyme-deficiency disorder, that if left untreated, would twist his hands into
claws, cause his joints to seize up, obscure his sight and hearing, and
eventually kill him sometime in his teens or 20s.
To further complicate matters, the Common Drug Review, an independent agency
that provides advice to Canadian governments, recommended against provincial
funding for Elaprase in January.
When the drug was eventually approved in 2003, Nicklas was finally able to get
his first dose of Aldurazyme.

Reflecting on the battle, he said: "With the UK being one of the pioneers of the
Vimizim drug, with it having been approved by the European Medicines Agency in
April, 2014 and being available in more than 20 other countries, it was baffling
the drug was not available in the UK.
"In addition to Morquio Syndrome, I learnt that people suffering from Tuberous
Sclerosis Complex and a rare form of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy were also
waiting for the drugs they needed to be approved.
"Of course, drugs have not yet been approved for those with Tuberous Sclerosis
Complex and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy so the #FundOurDrugsNOW campaign
continues full steam ahead.
"We prefer
dietary adjustment and pain control."
Pica

Often manifesting itself in the early stages of pregnancy, Pica leads to an
uncontrollable desires to consume certain foods and, in some cases, inedible
objects - sponges, lengths of wood, and bricks have all be reported as objects
of desire for sufferers, and it's common to be drawn to eating soil, coal or

Earlier this year, FDA granted Ilaris breakthrough therapy designations for
the three conditions, tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated periodic
syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase
deficiency (MKD) and familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).

FDA initially approved Ilaris, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1
beta, in 2009 for another periodic fever syndrome condition,
cryoporin-associated pediatric syndromes (CAPS).
The priority review approvals and the breakthrough designations are both based
on results of the Phase III CLUSTER study, which "showed rapid (at Day 15) and
sustained disease control with Ilaris compared to placebo through 16 weeks, in
patients with either TRAPS, HIDS/MKD or FMF," according to Novartis.

Agilis Biotherapeutics Announces FDA Orphan Drug Designation for AGIL-AS for
Treatment of Angelman Syndrome

LENGTH: 549  words


Nov. 4 -- Agilis Biotherapeutics, LLC (Agilis), a biotechnology company
advancing innovative DNA therapeutics for rare genetic diseases that affect the
central nervous system (CNS), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to AGIL-AS, the
Company's gene therapy product candidate being developed for the treatment of
Angelman syndrome (AS), a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by severe
intellectual and developmental disability.
This is the
first drug to be granted an Orphan Drug Designation status by the U.S. FDA for
the indication of Angelman syndrome.
"Receiving orphan drug designation from the FDA for AGIL-AS is another step on
our path to bringing this important new medicine to patients in dire need of an
effective, durable treatment.
Moreover, it signifies a landmark event, as it
marks the first Angelman syndrome drug to achieve this regulatory milestone,"
stated Mark Pykett, President and CEO of Agilis.
"We're extremely pleased that
we continue to make important clinical and regulatory progress, positioning us
to advance this new treatment to address such a devastating disease."
FDA Orphan Drug Designation is evaluated for drugs from all classes (e.g.
The designation provides sponsors with development
and commercial incentives, including seven years of market exclusivity in the
US, prioritized consultation by FDA on clinical studies, and certain exemptions
from or reductions in regulatory fees.
The new drug, Elaprase, developed by Shire Pharmaceuticals, has been approved in
the US and is expected to be licensed in Europe by the end of the year.
Between 2004 and 2006, the U.S. MDS market expanded when the first drug therapy
options were approved for the indication -- azacitidine (Celgene's Vidaza),
lenalidomide (Celgene's Revlimid) and decitabine (Eisai/MGI Pharma's Dacogen).
No new therapies have been approved in the United States for MDS since 2006;
only azacitidine has been approved for MDS in Europe, although experts believe
an EU approval for lenalidomide is imminent.
The FDA approved an investigational new drug application from Neuralstem Inc., a
Rockville, Md.-based biotech company, to test the safety of a treatment in which
patients will receive injections of the company's patented neural stem cells at
multiple sites along the spinal cord.

Expands Rare Disease Portfolio through Acquisition of U.S. Rights to KEVEYIS,
the First and Only FDA-Approved Treatment for Hyperkalemic, Hypokalemic, and
Related Variants of Primary Periodic Paralysis

Earlier today, Strongbridge announced in a separate press release that the
Company has acquired the U.S. rights to KEVEYIS, the first and only U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved product to treat hyperkalemic,
hypokalemic, and related variants of Primary Periodic Paralysis, which is a
group of rare hereditary disorders that causes potentially severe episodes of
muscle weakness and/or paralysis.
In addition, based upon Strongbridge's ongoing dialog with the FDA and
observation of the current regulatory landscape, the Company plans to initiate
LOGICS, a second global Phase 3 study of COR-003 for the treatment of endogenous
Cushing's syndrome.
The LOGICS study will supplement the long-term efficacy and
safety data from the ongoing SONICS study in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study that will enroll approximately 35 patients, of which
approximately two-thirds will have completed the SONICS study.
The addition of LOGICS will
provide an opportunity to enhance the body of evidence for COR-003 by generating
data in a well-controlled study," Cohen added.
COR-005
has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the European Medicines
Agency (EMA).
General and

30, 2015 included $1.7 million of legal and accounting fees related to the
indirect activities necessary to prepare the Company's financial records for the
U.S. initial public offering, which was completed in October 2015.
The remaining
net decrease was primarily due to lower legal fees in support of general
corporate matters, and lower employee recruiting fees and consulting fees for
general business efforts.
General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 included $3.7 million of legal and accounting fees related to the
indirect activities necessary to prepare the Company's financial records for the
U.S. initial public offering, which was completed in October 2015.
The remaining
net increase was primarily due to higher cash compensation and non-cash stock
based compensation costs due to increased employee count, partially offset by
decreased legal fees in support of general corporate matters, lower employee
recruiting fees and consulting fees for general business efforts.

FDA Grants SOBI003 Orphan Drug Designation for the Treatment of MPS IIIA

LENGTH: 605  words


July 5 -- Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi) has been granted Orphan Drug
Designation (ODD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
company's development candidate SOBI003, a chemically modified human recombinant
sulfamidase for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA),
also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type A, a rare metabolic disorder.
"We are very pleased with the Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for SOBI003.
The granting of an orphan designation request does not alter the standard
regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval.

Federal regulators have put millions of women at increased risk of getting toxic
shock syndrome by failing to come up with a uniform system for rating tampon
absorbency, says the head of a public health advocacy group.
Yet despite subsequent studies and the FDA's announced intention in 1984 to
require standardized absorbency labeling, the agency has "gone on again, off
again," he said.
In a statement issued last Thursday, the FDA said, "the agency did hope that an
industry agreement on standardization could produce useful information on the
labeling quicker than by regulation."
But manufacturers could not agree, it said, and the "agency is completing work
on a proposal now and hopes to publish it for public coment soon."
Also, it's complicated to
organize a randomized, controlled trial for a rare condition because the people
being studied are often scattered over a wide geographical area.

We appreciate that no government department has an unlimited budget.
However, new rules brought in by the
National Institute of Clinical Excellence, which issues guidelines on which
treatments should be available on the NHS, has revealed it is tightening its
criteria for funding drugs for rare diseases.
While the treatment is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration the drug
is not funded through the Federal Government's Life Saving Drugs Program.
The NephCure Kidney
Network will enable important clinical and patient-reported data on NS to be

"But every indication we have been given thus far is that the funding will not

Otley's MP Greg Mulholland (Lib Dem, Leeds North West) is also working with the
family and other MPs to lobby for the funding to be approved.

Oct. 11 -- Soligenix, Inc. (OTCQB: SNGXD) (Soligenix or the Company), a
late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing
products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced
today that it has been invited to present preliminary results from two programs
at National Organization for Rare Disorders' (NORD's) Rare Diseases and Orphan
Products Breakthrough Summit on October 17-18, 2016 in Arlington, VA.
The presented results will be available for viewing throughout the conference
and will address preclinical efficacy findings in two programs that have
previously been granted orphan drug designation by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA):

* Dusquetide in the treatment of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS); and

* RiVax, a proprietary thermostable ricin toxin vaccine, for the prevention of
ricin intoxication.

NORD's Rare Diseases and Orphan Products Breakthrough Summit features speakers
from the FDA, participation of patient organizations and the Pharma/Biotech
industry's foremost experts in orphan product innovation, investment and
commercialization.
About Dusquetide

Dusquetide is an innate defense regulator (IDR), a new class of short, synthetic
peptides.
Some of these preclinical findings have been
published in an article entitled "A novel approach for emerging and antibiotic
resistant infections: Innate defense regulators as an agnostic therapy" and are
available at the following link:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.03.032.
Drug products containing dusquetide have also received Fast Track Designations
from the FDA for the treatment of oral mucositis as a result of radiation and/or
chemotherapy treatment in head and neck cancer patients, and as an adjunctive
therapy with other antibacterial drugs, for the treatment of melioidosis.
The development of RiVax has been sponsored through a series of grants from both
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the
National Institutes of Health, and the FDA, which were granted to Soligenix and
to the University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) where the vaccine originated.

NPS buys back global rights to Gattex

BYLINE: by Ben Fidler

LENGTH: 596 words


NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s dreams of becoming a global player in rare-disease
therapies came closer to fruition on Tuesday as the company reacquired worldwide
rights to two treatments, including its flagship short-bowel syndrome drug,
Gattex.
NPS, of Bedminster, N.J., has obtained worldwide rights to Gattex and a
recombinant human parathyroid hormone known as PTH 1-84 from Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.
The relatively modest transactions give NPS worldwide rights to two drugs that
have the potential to succeed in orphan indications, known as such for their
small patient populations, high price tags and longer patent lives.
PTH 1-84, meanwhile, is already approved for osteoporosis in post-menopausal
women, but NPS has been testing the drug under the brand name Natpara to treat
hypoparathyroidism, a rare condition that occurs when the thyroid doesn't
produce enough parathyroid hormone and thus leaves a patient with low calcium
levels.
NPS aims to file an application with the FDA regarding Natpara in the
second half of the year.
NPS handed Nycomed International Management GmbH international rights to Gattex
in 2007 as part of a licensing deal worth a total of $185 million.
With full rights to the drugs, NPS is ready to roll out globally, even
announcing on Tuesday that it has hired former Genzyme executive Sandy Smith as
a consultant and wants to seek approval of both drugs in various key countries
outside of Europe, such as Japan.

Once Xadago is
approved by the regulators in both of these territories, we hope that many more
patients can begin using Xadago for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Following the disappointing news in March that the FDA had issued a CRL for
Xadago , we were delighted to announce in July, alongside our partners U.S.
WorldMeds and Zambon, that the FDA no longer required Newron to perform any
studies to clinically evaluate the potential abuse liability or
dependence/withdrawal effects of Xadago , the key subject of the CRL.
We
welcomed the announcement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in
October that it considers the September 2016 re-submission of the U.S. NDA by
Newron to be a complete Class 2 response to FDA's March 28, 2016 Complete
Response Letter (CRL).
The FDA has determined the user fee goal date (PDUFA
date) to be March 21, 2017.
We are hopeful that Xadago will be approved in the
USA on or before its PDUFA date and that it will become available to U.S.
patients, soon.
In May, the FDA approved our Investigational New Drug (IND) application for
the evaluation of sarizotan for the treatment of patients with Rett syndrome.

Netherlands.

Alongside, we
will continue to review products and product candidates that need certain
regulatory and development efforts to repurpose them and that could contribute
to the objective of a sustainable pipeline of development projects.

Then McFadyen learned about Naglazyme, a drug not yet been approved for use in
Canada.
Naglazyme was approved seven years ago.
Last year, he spent
220 days on the road, often working with the families of patients with rare
diseases to get access to both unapproved and experimental drugs.
Accessing unapproved drugs through the Special Access Programme leads to a
proper review of all safety and efficacy data by an objective third party before
any drug is given to a patient, McFadyen says.
"Health-care providers and hospitals feel more comfortable providing an
unapproved drug to a patient, knowing that it's been properly vetted and looked
at by Health Canada.
The draft includes proposed measures to
imprison or fine "any provider of a potential life-saving treatment who
knowingly fails to comply

with this act or the regulations."
"There are many reasons why a physician may not want to treat a patient with an
unapproved drug.
"Patients aren't objective when making a decision to try an unapproved drug.

"We are proud to support NORD (The National Organization for Rare Disorders in
the USA) and EURORDIS (the European Organization for Rare Diseases) to raise
awareness for rare diseases and their devastating impact on patients' lives,"
said Stefan Weber, CEO of Newron, "We are particularly honored to support groups
such as Rettsyndrome.org and Curerett.org, who are dedicated to improving the
lives of girls living with Rett syndrome, which is one of more than 6,000 rare
diseases."

Leeds mum's fears over future of son's pioneering treatment

LENGTH: 533  words


A mum has spoken of her fears over a new drug funding rule which could leave her
son without access to the pioneering treatment she spent two years fighting for
him to receive.
Katy Brown, from Otley, tirelessly campaigned for her son, Sam, now eight - who
has life-limiting Morquio Syndrome - to receive Vimizim, a drug which health
regulator NICE finally agreed to fund in 2015 for five years.
But new rules - which came into effect on April 1 - have thrown its future use
beyond that into doubt after NICE announced a cap on the cost of new medicines.
The new rules involve the introduction of a £300,000 quality-adjusted life year
(QALY) threshold for medicines evaluated through NICE's Highly Specialised
Technologies (HST) programme for very rare conditions.
In a letter to NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon, Mrs Brown
described the new rules as "like a cruel and depressing version of Groundhog
Day", writing: "Your consultation singles out people with the protected
characteristic of disability, and directly stops their access to new treatments
for no other reason than the condition that they were unfortunate enough to be
born with is ultra rare."

The National Organization for Rare Disorders, known as NORD, lists more than

"NORD is very happy that Pfizer is establishing a Rare Diseases Research Unit,"
Peter L. Saltonstall, president and chief executive of the organization, said in

Though rare diseases don't offer the potential large markets that drugs
targeting major disorders can tap into, the barriers for getting therapies
approved are lower, which reduces the costs associated with developing
medicines.
So-called orphan drugs -- therapies that treat diseases in which no
remedy is currently available -- receive favorable treatment from the FDA,
accelerating the speed at which companies can bring products to market.
Pfizer signaled its interest in rare diseases late last year, when it bought the
rights to an experimental drug to fight Gaucher's disease, an enzyme deficiency
that can damage the liver and bone marrow, occasionally leading to death.

Washington: FDA approves expanded indications for Ilaris for three rare diseases

LENGTH: 490  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: US Food and Drug Administration, The Government of USA has issued
the following news release:



 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved three new indications for
Ilaris (canakinumab).
There are no
previously approved therapies for TRAPS or HIDS/MKD.
"For the first time, patients with TRAPS and HIDS/MKD, two painful and life
altering diseases, have access to a treatment that may help improve their
quality of life," said Badrul Chowdhury, M.D., Ph.D, director of the Division of
Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research.
Ilaris was previously approved for another periodic fever syndrome called
Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) and for active systemic juvenile
idiopathic arthritis.
Health care professionals should review the prescribing
information in the labeling for detailed information about the approved uses.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, security of
human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human
use, and medical devices.
The agency is also responsible for the safety and
security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products
that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.
A panel comprising Global Genes Medical and Scientific Advisory Board members
and patient advocacy leaders evaluated the submissions on extent of the contact,
compassion, novelty, and insight to determine the winners.
It is a degenerative condition that
causes irreversible damage but a drug called Vimizim, approved at European level
and used in 20 other European countries, but not the UK, can halt the worsening
of the condition.
In
December, after the threat of legal action that the scorecard was discriminatory
towards those with rare diseases, NHS England accepted this and suspended use of
the scorecard.
NHS England
drew up a flawed scorecard process and was forced to scrap it.

Orphan diseases that fail to get much attention

said Christina Hellmann, chairman of the Joshua Hellmann Foundation
for Orphan Disease which advocates the rights of rare disease patients.
The rare syndrome, which became better known when golfer Casey Martin battled
the PGA over his right to use a golf cart, causes blood vessels to grow
uncontrollably in large bundles.
There isn't a cure, but a new drug called Vimizim, approved by Health Canada in
2014, could help.
Some
cases, he said, get approved and others will not.
It will be part of a treatment plan approved by Morgan's geneticist at the IWK
Children's Hospital in Halifax.
Few FDA-approved drugs are
available, and the use of off-label drugs can cause several adverse effects.
Discussions with regulatory agencies in the U.S. and
Europe are nearing completion for the design of a potential pivotal trial in
iCCA.
The company received approval of its IND
application from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the PROS family of
rare diseases, including Proteus syndrome, for a potential clinical trial.
"Encouraging discussions and
positive feedback from the regulatory agencies, combined with the totality of
the efficacy data we have observed in the clinical trials, has moved us closer
to defining a pivotal trial design for ARQ 087 in this indication."
We expect to report top-line data during the
first half of 2017 and, subject to a completed trial with supporting data, to
file applications for regulatory approval in the United States and the European
Union in the second half of 2017.
Cortendo Expands Rare Endocrine Disease Franchise with Completion of
Transactions for Two-Late Stage Assets

Cortendo has completed its previously announced transactions to in-license
commercialization rights to Antisense Therapeutics' ATL1103 for endocrinology
applications and to acquire Aspireo Pharmaceuticals' Somatoprim (DG3173), an
investigational compound being studied for the treatment of acromegaly.
The issuance of shares for use in the acquisition of
COR-005 was approved by Cortendo shareholders at an Annual General Meeting (AGM)
on June 25, 2015.
The issuance of these additional shares was approved by
Cortendo shareholders at an AGM on June 25, 2015.
Dravet Syndrome is a rare and hard-to-control form of epilepsy that begins in
infancy.
Individuals with Dravet Syndrome need constant care and supervision, which can
be financially and emotionally draining for caregivers.
"We can't rule out genetic factors
playing a role," he said.
But his family have been devastated to learn funding for the drug is unlikely to
be approved.
But she added: "Every indication we have been given thus far is that the funding
will not be approved, which means his treatment would stop and the disease would
be allowed to progress.
"Despite the UK being the major player involved in the clinical development of
Vimizim and British and Irish citizens being part of the clinical trial process,
we are some of the last countries in Europe to have the drug funding approved,"
she said.

Anavex Announces US FDA Orphan Drug Designation for ANAVEX 2-73 for Treatment of
Infantile Spasms

LENGTH: 454  words


June 22 -- Anavex Life Sciences Corp. ("Anavex" or the "Company") (Nasdaq:AVXL),
a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing differentiated
therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental
diseases including Alzheimer's disease, other central nervous system (CNS)
diseases, pain and various types of cancer, today reports the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's Office of Orphan Product Development has granted Orphan Drug
Designation to ANAVEX 2-73 for the treatment of infantile spasms.
The FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development advances the evaluation of drugs
that show promise for the safe treatment of rare diseases, defined as those
affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.
The designation
provides sponsors with development and commercial incentives, including seven
years of market exclusivity in the U.S., prioritized consultation by FDA on
clinical studies and certain exemptions from or reductions in regulatory fees.
While Chipotle works to reassure customers that its food is safe, Montreal
drugmaker, Bellus Health Inc., is the only company in the world developing a
treatment for a sometimes fatal complication to the bacteria and will be taking
the treatment to the FDA to begin U.S. studies next year.
Bellus bought the rights to Shigamab (originally developed by the U.S. Army
because the Shiga toxin is a Level 2 biohazard) when it acquired Montreal-based
Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. in 2013.
Bellus' flagship product, Kiacta, which is used for treating another rare kidney
disease, will be on its way to gaining regulatory approval by the middle of next
year and has been modelled by Zacks Small Cap Research to be priced at an
estimated $200,000 per year in the U.S. "I think it's accepted that it just
costs so much to develop drugs these days and if you've got 10 million people
who take your drug it's pretty easy to recoup your cost, but when you've got
5,000 people who take your drug it's got to be priced high," Martin said.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the Investigational New
Drug (IND) application for OrbeShield for the mitigation of morbidity and
mortality associated with GI ARS.
OrbeShield has also been granted Orphan Drug
and Fast Track designations by the FDA for the prevention of death following a
potentially lethal dose of total body irradiation during or after a radiation
disaster.
Sanofi Genzyme Rare Diseases global head Richard Peters said: "According to the
centres for disease control and prevention, the cause of death in most cases of
acute radiation syndrome is the destruction of the person's bone marrow.

Washington roundup: CMS pays out awards for HHA P4P as FDA scrutinizes devices

LENGTH: 1277 words

Medical Device Daily Washington Editor

Pay for performance, or P4P, is all the rage in hospitals doing business with
Medicare, but the same may eventually be said for home health agencies (HHAs) if
a demonstration project successfully runs its course.
The Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services reported last week that it had awarded an unspecified amount
of money to home health agencies (HHAs) that scored high on quality measures,
and first-year numbers suggest that P4P may work in this realm of healthcare in
much the same way as it does in hospitals.
The attempt to bolster quality of care by offering payments for performance may
encounter some financial headwinds, at least where home care operators are
concerned, given that FDA is in the process of imposing more regulatory
requirements of makers of devices that operate in homes.
According to a fact
sheet published by CMS in 2007, the agency will award 75% of the bonus money to
agencies that score in the top 20% while the remaining 25% of the bonus monies
will go to HHAs that demonstrate the greatest improvements.
PTO to webcast roundtable

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has consistently demonstrated that it is
serious in its efforts to deal with patent quality and patent the backlog, and
recently announced that it will hold a series of roundtables with stakeholders
to obtain feedback on how the agency can improve patent quality.
PTO director David Kappos said in the statement that quality patents "are
critical to the proper functioning of the patent system, and issuing high
quality patents is a top priority" for the agency.
The May 18 event will run from 8:30 until noon Eastern time and will be webcast
from the agency's web site at
