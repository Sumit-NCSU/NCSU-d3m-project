New Delhi, Jan. 30 -- The R.A.R.E.
Project (www.rareproject.org) and The Global
Genes Project (www.globalgenesproject.org), leading patient advocacy
organizations representing the rare disease community, today announced they are
hosting a rare disease 'blog hop' to kick off a month long awareness campaign
leading up to the fifth annual World Rare Disease Day on February 29, 2012.

Rare diseases affect 30 million Americans, approximately 350 million people
globally, and consist of 7,000 different types of diseases and disorders.
According to the Kakkis Everylife Foundation, 95% of rare diseases have no
treatments, leaving tens of millions of patients and families without hope.
Today over 40 leading bloggers joined forces to blog about the realities of
living with various rare diseases.
Stories are showcased from patients and
families who are affected by Batten's Disease, CIDP, Chronic Inflammatory
Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), Chronic Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID),
Citrullinemia, Cystinuria, Epidermolysis Bullosa, Fibromuscular Dysplasia,
Gaucher's Disease, Hunter Syndrome, Huntington's Disease, Joubert Syndrome,
Kleefstra Syndrome, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
, Maple Syrup Urine Disease, Marfan Syndrome, Mitochondrial Myopathy, Moebius
Syndrome, Nager Syndrome, Neimann Pick Type C, Pallister-Killian Syndrome,
Primary Immune Deficiency Disease (PIDD), Pseudotumor Cerebri, Sanfilippo
Syndrome, Spina Bifida and more.
"Rare disease patient organizations are beginning to realize that they are
facing the exact same issues when it comes to developing treatments and cures
for their specific rare disease," said Nicole Boice, president, R.A.R.E.
"By combining our voices and teaming up, we can begin to be heard on
national level and together create the changes needed to spur drug development
for all rare diseases."
1 Million for Rare Campaign

The R.A.R.E.
Project and The Global Genes Project are asking rare disease
patient advocacy groups to support the awareness efforts through the month of
February in a variety of ways:

* Join the 1 Million for Rare disease awareness campaign by going to Facebook
and "liking" the 1 Million for Rare awareness movement -
http://www.facebook.com/globalgenesproject

* In addition to joining the 1 Million for Rare movement, supporters are asked
to spread the word to their social networks and display the 1 Million For Rare

Biotechnology Industry Organization has issued the following news release:

Leaders in Rare Disease Community Unite for National Cushing's Syndrome
Awareness Day on April 8

Cortendo AB (publ) [ticker: CORT on NOTC-A], a global biopharmaceutical company
focused on rare endocrine disorders and other rare diseases, and the National
Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)®, a leading, independent nonprofit
organization committed to the identification, treatment and cure of rare
diseases, today announced that Cortendo has joined NORD's Corporate Council.
The NORD Corporate Council is composed of a select group of leading companies
committed to helping people with rare diseases, also known as orphan diseases.
The Council provides a unique opportunity for interaction with the rare disease
community, including patient advocacy organizations, and enables companies to
discuss emerging trends with top experts in the worldwide rare disease effort.
Members include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and other
companies engaged in the aspects of health care for the rare disease/orphan
product community.
"We are pleased to have Cortendo join NORD's Corporate Council, and we
appreciate their commitment to bring innovative new therapies to market for the
treatment of orphan indications with their initial focus targeting rare
endocrine disorders and Cushing's Syndrome," said Peter L. Saltonstall,
president and chief executive officer of NORD.
Cushing's Syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder that is caused by prolonged
exposure to elevated levels of cortisol produced within the body or introduced
from outside the body.
Symptoms of Cushing's Syndrome may include abnormal
weight gain, upper body obesity, thin purple streaks on the skin, fatigue,
diabetes, high blood pressure, and depression.
"Cortendo is proud to announce joining NORD's Corporate Council today, which
marks National Cushing's Syndrome Awareness Day," said Matthew Pauls, president
and chief executive officer of Cortendo.
"Our partnership with NORD reinforces
Cortendo's commitment to advancing research and development efforts that may
improve the lives of people with rare diseases, including our currently
recruiting Phase 3 trial of the investigational compound COR-003
(levoketoconazole), which is being studied in Cushing's Syndrome."
A rare disease is defined as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000
Americans.
In the U.S., an estimated 30 million people (1 in 10 individuals)
have a rare disease, many of which can be chronic and can be life-threatening.
Fewer than 400 of the 7,000 rare diseases have FDA-approved treatments.
National Cushing's Syndrome Awareness Day occurs on April 8 because it is the
birthday of Harvey Cushing (1869-1939), the American physician, surgeon and
endocrinologist who discovered and reported the disease in 1932.

Bill hopes to help Filipinos with rare diseases

BYLINE:  Charles E. Buban

As the country observed last month the National Rare Disease Week (every fourth
week of March), Sen. Pia Cayetano said a bill is now being pushed to eventually
mandate the government to assist individuals with rare disease by means of
increasing their access to medical treatment and drugs, and include them in the
coverage of the Universal Health Care program.
2098, or the "Rare Disease Act of
2014," the Department of Health (DOH) will be tasked to establish a National
Rare Disease Registry, which will include an inventory of rare diseases in the
country, information on diagnosed patients and a list of certified medicines and
medical devices.
Interestingly, similar bills tacking rare diseases are also being pushed in the
lower House by Representatives Baby Arenas, Randolph Ting, Alfred Vargas and Gus
Tambunting.
A "rare disease" is one that affects less than one in every 20,000 individuals.
In most cases the rare diseases manifest during childhood and are genetic in
origin.
Hard time coping

Cayetano in a statement explained that patients, who are mostly children, are
chronically ill and suffer from pain and isolation throughout their life.
She
added that their families also have a hard time coping because treatment is not
only very costly but are not readily available in most hospitals and clinics.
Gaucher Disease, Maple Syrup Urine Disease, Pompe Disease, Galactosemia,
Phenylketonuria, Methylmalonic Acidemia, Urea Cycle Defects, Hurler Syndrome,
Hunter Syndrome, Prader-Willi Syndrome, Edward Syndrome and Patau Syndrome are
just some of the rare diseases now identified in the Philippines.
Rare disease is an issue quite close to the senator considering that in 2001,
Cayetano lost her youngest child Gabriel from a rare congenital condition called
Trisomy 13 (also called Patau Syndrome).
Babies afflicted with Trisomy 13 have a
very low survival rate-Gabriel lived for nine months-because they suffer from
various ailments that include poor heart conditions, kidney problem, recurring
respiratory infections, gastro-intestinal problems, poor eyesight and poor
hearing.
She also has a son afflicted with
Pompe disease, another type of rare condition.
Newborn screening

Both the senator and Magdaraog believe that the number of diagnosed patients
with rare diseases could still rise now that the upcoming newborn screening
(NBS) program of the government will be expanded to 28 rare diseases beginning
this year.
Newborn screening is a procedure intended for early identification of infants
who are affected by certain genetic, metabolic, or infectious conditions that
may lead to mental retardation or morbidity if left untreated.
From 1996 to December 2010, the program has saved 45 283 patients.
Rare disease

Furthermore, Senate Bill 2098 is also recommending the inclusion of rare disease
treatment in the health benefit package of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp.
with medical drugs and devices used for treating rare diseases be certified by
the Food and Drugs Administration  to facilitate the public's access to these
products.
Also, the same bill seeks to help patients suspected or diagnosed with rare
disease to be referred to regional NSCs, which will then coordinate with the DOH
and concerned medical facilities for the "co-management" of the patient with a
specialist.
At present, the NBS in the country includes screening of six disorders:
congenital hypothyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, phenylketonuria,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, galactosemia and maple syrup urine
disease.

Rare Disease Day this Saturday

This Saturday, February 28 will mark Rare Disease Day, an unofficial day
recognising people across the world affected by a rare disease.
The day takes place on the last day of February each year in an effort to raise
awareness amongst the general public and decision-makers about rare diseases and
their impact on patients' lives.
Locally there are less than a handful of community members diagnosed with a rare
disease however Whyalla Special Education Centre principal Michelle Grocke said
it was still valuable to recognise the challenges and the impact these diseases
have on them.
"Children with rare diseases require recognition and support," Ms Grocke said.
"They often go unnoticed as there is more awareness for the more occurring
conditions such as autism and Down syndrome."
Student Holly Gerahty was diagnosed with a rare syndrome known as WAGR shortly
after her six-week GP check-up when the doctor noticed something was not right
with her eyes.
A blood test was sent to the UK for DNA testing and the results confirmed that
Holly had WAGR Syndrome.
This year marks six years of Rare Disease Day in Australia and continuing this
momentum, Rare Disease Day 2015 puts a focus on the daily lives of patients,
families and caregivers who are 'Living with a Rare Disease'.
Due to the uniqueness of each zebra within the species (no two zebra patterns
are alike), the zebra has been chosen as symbol to represent all exotic or rare
medical diseases.
To help raise awareness of WAGR syndrome and other rare diseases, community
members can wear black and white or zebra stripes this Saturday.
Community members are also encouraged to show their support by raising and
joining hands to show their solidarity with people living with a rare disease
and then take a picture and send it to www.rarediseaseday.org/join-your-hands/

momentum, Rare Disease Day 2015 puts a focus on the daily lives of patients,
families and caregivers who are 'Living with a Rare Disease'.
Due to the uniqueness of each zebra within the species (no two zebra patterns
are alike), the zebra has been chosen as symbol to represent all exotic or rare
medical diseases.
To help raise awareness of WAGR syndrome and other rare diseases, community
members can wear black and white or zebra stripes this Saturday.
Community members are also encouraged to show their support by raising and
joining hands to show their solidarity with people living with a rare disease
and then take a picture and send it to www.rarediseaseday.org/join-your-hands/

WEEKENDER: feature;
MEDICINE CABINET: Rare Disease Day marked this month

BYLINE: Reiner W. Gloor

SECTION: Pg.
This
year, Rare Disease Day falls on Feb. 29.
According to the Web site rarediseaseday.org, the objective for this event is to
"raise awareness amongst the general public and decision-makers about rare
diseases and their impact on patients' lives."
The campaign also aims to target
policy makers, public authorities, industry representatives, researchers, health
professionals, and anyone who might have a genuine interest in rare diseases.
This occasion was established in 2008 and has since reached hundreds of
thousands of people all over the world and has contributed to the advancement of
plans and policies for rare diseases in a number of countries.
1989 signed by
former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2010, the last week of February has
been designated as National Rare Disease Week.
So what is a rare disease?
In Europe, a disease or disorder is classified as
"rare" when it affects fewer than one person in 2,000.
In the USA, that
classification is given when the disease or disorder affects fewer than 200,000
Americans at any given time.
In the European Union alone, it is estimated that
as many as 30 million people may be affected by one of over 6,000 existing rare
diseases.
Eighty percent of rare diseases are rooted in genetic origins, with the
remaining possibly resulting from bacterial or viral infections, allergies,
environmental causes, or are degenerative and proliferative.
Some 50% of rare
diseases touch children.
There are unique challenges facing those who suffer from rare diseases.
With
over 6,000 known rare diseases and with each one having its own broad diversity
of disorders and symptoms, this may lead to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.
Furthermore, many of these diseases present as chronic, progressive,
degenerative, and frequently life- threatening, disabling the patient and adding
to their pain.
The lack of effective cures compound the frustration and
suffering for the patients and their families.
The lack of quality health care can lead to inequalities and difficulties in
access to treatment and care.
This may often result in heavy social and
financial burdens on patients.
2098 or the "Rare Disease Act of 2014."
Section 5 provides for the identification of persons with rare diseases and the
creation of a Rare Disease Registry.
Health care practitioners and institutions
must report diagnoses of rare diseases to the Registry of the DoH, along with
reports on the status of each patient.
Section 6 provides for referral of patients suspected or already diagnosed with
a rare disease to the Regional Newborn Screening Center nearest them in order to
ensure they receive adequate medical care.
Section 8 and 9 declares that persons with rare diseases will have the same
benefits as persons with disabilities, as provided by Republic Act No.
Section 19 details that the DoH must ensure a system is in place to facilitate
the qualification of a patient with a rare disease as a beneficiary of medical
management services for their disease.
Treatment of their respective condition
shall be included in the benefit package from the Philippine Health Insurance
Corp. or PhilHealth, with revenues generated from the Sin Tax to include medical
assistance to patients with rare disease.
Some examples of rare diseases are: Gaucher Disease, Maple Syrup Urine Disease,
Pompe Disease, Galactosemia, Phenylketonuria, Methylmalonic Acidemia, Urea Cycle
Defects, Hurler Syndrome, Hunter Syndrome, Prader- Willi Syndrome, Edward
Syndrome, and Patau Syndrome.
Awareness about these diseases is still very low but seeing Senate Bill No.

Mum's photos look at child beyond disease;
Photographer Ceridwen Hughes started the not for profit group Same But Different
to discourage people from judging people by appearance and took these photos to
show the real personalities of children with rare conditions.
Each child has been diagnosed with a rare disease.
The images were taken by mum Ceredwen Hughes, whose son Isaac has the rare
genetic disease Moebius.
His condition results in paralysis of facial nerves, and while his family could
easily see changes in his expressions others were unable to.
Ceridwen sought to capture Isaac's personality photographically herself and her
success led her to create Same But Different and The Rare Project, featuring
many young people and children with rare diseases.
Ceridwen has worked with several families over the last 12 months to build a
gallery of images that really capture the person behind each rare condition.
Same But Different, a not for profit organisation, will launch The Rare Project
using photography to showcase the work, which is hoped will highlight the
obstacles the children and their families face.
"Isaac loves to tease and make fun of his friends - even though he was born with
a condition that means he can't smile," said Ceridwen.
"The Rare Project encourages people to get to know young people and children
with rare diseases for their personalities and not their condition," said his
mum.
"It's vitally important that we break down barriers and empower people to have a
voice so the people behind rare diseases can be seen.
People often make
judgements based on the superficial and I wanted to help people look past the
conditions and see the person behind that.
"Rare diseases affect one in 17 people in the UK.
They are far more common than
many people imagine and so the project also hopes to raise awareness of the
6,000-8,000 rare diseases that exist," she added.
"The charity Findacure defines many rare diseases as 'fundamental diseases'.
For
example the research into a rare condition such as Prader-Willi syndrome, which
affects appetite and diet, is a doorway to informing understanding of common
conditions such as obesity and diabetes."
Same But Different has recently partnered with Climb, a charity supporting
families affected by more than 700 Inherited Metabolic Diseases (IMDs) making up
a large proportion of rare diseases.
She has Leigh's disease, a condition of the
central nervous system.
Despite her condition Alex doesn't let it stop her from travelling to Florida to
visit Disney World and her favourite characters Mickey, Minnie and Jimini
Cricket.
He has Crouzon syndrome,
a condition where skull bones fuse prematurely.
Crouzon syndrome hasn't got in the way of Matthew's love of football and he
hopes to play for Real Madrid or Manchester United.

National Organization for Rare Disorders Awards Grant to Support Research in
Stiff-Person Syndrome

LENGTH: 579  words

DATELINE: Karachi


Karachi, Jan. 14 -- The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) has
awarded a research grant for the study of stiff-person syndrome, a rare acquired
neurological disorder,1 to Eric Lancaster, MD, PhD of the University of
Pennsylvania.
The study is titled, "Auto-Antigen Profiling in Stiff-Person
Syndrome."
This grant is made possible through funds contributed by Lundbeck
Inc. in connection with a special program conducted in the month leading up to
Rare Disease Day in 2010.
Specifically, Lundbeck conducted a web-based campaign,
"Raise Your Hand to Fight Rare Diseases," an initiative for Rare Disease Day
2010 that led the company to donate $10,000 to NORD's general research fund.
Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in
the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise,
touch, and emotional distress, which can set off muscle spasms.2 The exact
prevalence of SPS is unknown, although the incidence is believed to be
approximately 1 in 1,000,000 individuals in the general population.1 Women are
affected twice as often as men.2 Scientists don't yet understand what causes
SPS, but research indicates that it is the result of an autoimmune response gone
awry in the brain and spinal cord.2

"Imagine being afraid for your child to spontaneously hug you, or to be greeted
by a neighbor, step from a curb, or even leave your house, because of the fear
of painful muscle spasms and potentially serious falls.
I am encouraged to
know that there are scientists who are interested in this very rare disease and
that NORD is able to fund the research."
"There has been limited research on stiff-person syndrome so we were quite
pleased when our medical advisory committee granted Dr. Lancaster the award,"
said Peter L. Saltonstall, NORD president and CEO.
"Lundbeck is very pleased to know that our donation through the Raise Your Hand
campaign will fund research for this very challenging disease," said Mark
Weinberg, vice president in medical affairs at Lundbeck Inc. "Through our work
in rare diseases, we've come to appreciate the hardships faced by these
communities of patients and the value of research for even the rarest diseases.
With Rare Disease Day 2011 around the corner, we look forward to making another
meaningful donation through this same campaign."
About Rare Diseases

There are approximately 7,000 rare diseases or conditions affecting an estimated
30 million Americans, though the number of individuals confronting any one of
these disorders can be quite small.
Individuals with rare diseases often face
challenges that occur less frequently with more common disorders, including
difficulty in finding medical experts, delay in receiving an accurate diagnosis,
and access to few, if any, treatment options.
In the United States, rare
diseases, also referred to as "orphan diseases", are generally defined as
diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.

'We knew James had problems, we just didn't know the name forthem - and nor did
anyone else for 13 years' ;
It is estimated that 175,000 people living in Wales have a rare disease.
As
Wales marks Rare Disease Day this week, health editor Madeleine Brindley spoke
to one mother about her 13-year fight to get her son diagnosed them - and nor
did anyone else for 13 years'

BYLINE: Madeleine Brindley

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg.
It would be 13 years before James was finally diagnosed with a rare disease that
few clinicians in Wales had even heard of.
Now 28, James is facing blindness - he will receive a guide dog called Wally
this week - and he has been told that he, like the handful of other people with
Laurence Moon Bardet Biedl (LMBB) syndrome in Wales, will not be allowed to
attend a new half-day clinic once a year held in either London or Birmingham.
His mother Chris, through her work as national co-ordinator of the Laurence Moon
Bardet Biedl Society, helped to set up the clinics but the NHS in Wales has said
that patients will not be able to attend the clinics.
James has not had any ongoing medical care from a clinician with expertise in
LMBB syndrome since he was 17, when he was discharged from paediatric health
services.
"People with rare diseases need to be able to access clinics that have the
clinical experts who know how to correctly diagnose and can best manage their
condition.
"For many rare conditions there are no designated clinics available.
"But for those conditions where these clinics exist and are available, people
like my son James should be able to and allowed to access them, regardless of
where they live in the UK."
Laurence Moon Bardet Biedl syndrome is a group of features which that occur
together to characterise a medical disorder.
In the
1920s Bardet and Biedl independently added to the original description of the
syndrome.
It is a rare inherited disorder which affects about one in 100,000 babies born -
it is thought that there are about 25 to 30 people with LMBB syndrome in Wales.
The syndrome causes visual impairment, which will ultimately lead to blindness;
obesity; developmental delays and problems with speech and co-ordination and
kidney abnormalities.
Some babies with the syndrome are also born with extra fingers or toes, or with
partially fused digits.
At the age of 12, the Humphreyses were contacted by social services who told
them James' natural sister may have had an unnamed hereditary condition.
"I got in touch with the paediatrician who wasn't certain and then we went down
the route of different syndromes that he could have.
Chris, who will speak at an event at the Senedd, in Cardiff, to mark Rare
Disease Day on Wednesday, added: "After the euphoria of diagnosis came the
depression of what was ahead.
"For everything else in this syndrome some form of medical intervention will
help - years ago kidney problems could result in death.
A Welsh Assembly Government spokeswoman said about access to the specialist
clinic: "The Welsh Assembly Government provides funding and support for
specialised services for rare diseases such as Laurence Moon Bardet Biedl
Syndrome (LMBB).
"Our annual plan for specialised services in Wales includes provision for Welsh
patients suffering from LMBB and significant funding for these patients has
already been allocated in our budget.
"This money is available to enable patients who require treatment at the LMBB
diagnostic and management services in Birmingham and London to access these
services.
"We will be in touch with the clinical directors of these services to ensure
they fully understand that the services they provide are available for patients
living in Wales, especially children requiring early diagnosis and family
support, and that their treatment will be fully funded by the Assembly
Government.

Laurence Moon Bardet Biedl Society visit www.lmbbs.org.uk Rare disease day Rare
Disease Day, on Wednesday, is a global event designed to raise awareness of rare
diseases and improve services for those affected.
A rare disease is one which affects about one in 2,000 people.
They are
surprisingly common - 175,000 people in Wales (3.5 million in the UK) - live
with a rare condition at some point in their lives.
There are more than 6,000 different rare conditions and they include
Huntington's Disease, Myasthenia Gravis, all childhood cancers and other
conditions, which are less familiar, such as Mal de Debarquement Syndrome,
Juvenile Batten Disease and Behçets Syndrome.
Rare diseases vary in severity and symptoms, but people living with these
conditions report similar issues around diagnosis and treatment.
It can take patients years to get a firm diagnosis, which can often result in
their conditions deteriorating, inappropriate treatment and medication, and
significant distress.
Rare Disease UK is now campaigning for a strategy in Wales and for integrated
services to speed up diagnosis and ensure there is effective treatment and care
for people living with rare conditions.
Alastair Kent, chair of Rare Disease UK, said: "There are tens of thousands of
people in Wales and millions of people in the UK living with rare conditions.
"For many, the information available on their conditions is scarce and
scientific research is lacking.
"Raising awareness of rare diseases and the need for a co-ordinated strategy for
the diagnosis, treatment and research of rare diseases is hugely important."
Rare disease facts 75% of rare diseases affect children and 30% of patients will
die before their fifth birthday; One in 17 people will develop a rare condition
at some point in their life; 80% of rare diseases have identified genetic
origins.
Other rare diseases are the result of infections, allergies and
environmental causes, or are degenerative and proliferative; Rare diseases are
often chronic, progressive, degenerative, and often life-threatening; Rare
diseases are disabling - quality of life is often compromised; patients and
their families can suffer high levels of pain; and rare disease patients face a
number of problems, including a lack of access to correct diagnosis and a lack
of quality information.
His rare disease, Laurence Moon Bardet Biedl syndrome, was finally diagnosed
when he was a teenager - and then only thanks to Chris' persistence and
determination PICTURE: Andrew Davies

RARE diseases   while individually uncommon   affect one person in every 17 with
around 80% of them having a genetic component.
Between 6,000 and 8,000 known rare diseases exist, and about 30 million people
across Europe are affected by a rare disease.
Prof Hans Lochmüller's research will look at the following rare diseases:
Muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, Cystic Fibrosis, spinocerebellar
ataxia, Huntington's disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
epidermolysis bullosa, Rett syndrome, Marfan syndrome, hemochromatosis,
thalassaemia, mucopolysaccharidosis, polycystic kidney disease, Nephrotic
syndrome, haemophilia, progeria and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Not as rare as you thought

Misdiagnosis, lack of specialist doctors, hospital protocol - there seems to be
too many stumbling blocks in the way of identification and treatment of unusual
diseases in HK.
Lau suffers from Marfan syndrome, a rare disease caused by a genetic mutation
that weakens the body's connective tissue.
Hong Kong maintains no official
record of people detected with Marfan syndrome.
Doctors know little of the
disease.
There are no special facilities for patients suffering from the rare
disease.
"Hong Kong attaches the least importance to genetic diseases, or the so-called
rare diseases, compared to other economies.
No special measures have been
implemented, even for the detection of rare diseases," says Lam Ching-wan,
clinical professor at the Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing (LKS) Faculty of
Medicine at the University of Hong Kong.
Lam has been researching rare diseases
for more than 20 years.
And do you have a family history of heart diseases?"
"Then the doctor gave me his diagnosis - gastro-esophageal reflux disease
(GERD)," says Lau.
GERD is a disease of the stomach which can cause severe chest
pains.
Diagnosis errors

"The chance of misdiagnosis in rare diseases could be more than 80 percent," Lam
said, citing his own research data.
"That definitely affects patients' health.
Doctors later concluded Larson died from undiagnosed Marfan
syndrome.
Doctors suspected it was Marfan syndrome but couldn't be positive without
further examination.
Marfan syndrome requires a gene test to establish a
definitive diagnosis.
A hazy area

The Marfan Syndrome Association in Hong Kong states that one in 5,000 people
have the syndrome, citing statistics published by the National Marfan Foundation
in the United States.
The city does not have a database of statistics nor an official definition of
the about 6,000 other rare diseases identified globally.
According to the World Health Organization, in every 10,000 people, 6.5 to 10
suffer from rare diseases.
That implies that in Hong Kong about 45 newborn
infants every year are born with a rare disease, extrapolated from births
averaging 45,000 per year, says Lam, the pathologist from the University of Hong
Kong.
Some patients may die before they are
diagnosed... 150 to 200 rare diseases have been diagnosed in Hong Kong but the
actual number is higher.
Doctors who are
not specialized in genetics have difficulty verifying rare diseases."
"The courses taught in medical schools cover only the most common
diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.
It all depends on
whether or not a doctor has knowledge of rare diseases (related to the
symptoms)," Lam added.
Only six medicines for four kinds of rare diseases are listed on the Hospital
Authority Drug Formulary.
Taiwan, however, has identified 204 rare diseases and established
specific definitions for them.
Taiwan provides 85 medicines for about 1,000
rare-disease-afflicted patients as of December 2014.
Due to the lack of market demand and because of the prolonged research and
development phase, private pharmaceutical companies seem to be disinterested in
producing medicines for rare diseases.
"Only if the team confirms that the medicine will benefit a patient in a
specific stage of the disease in an obvious way will they authorize that
medicine," said Lam.
New rights group

The last day of February is marked as International Rare Diseases Day.
The Hong
Kong Alliance for Rare Diseases was established on that day this year, with a
mission to urge the government to protect the human rights of this largely
unrepresented group.
"Early detection and even early diagnosis are significant to a patient of rare
disease.
Lam says an undiagnosed disease program at the medical school of the University
of Hong Kong, has been providing clinical help to patients with rare diseases
since November 2014, on a two-year grant from the S.K.
"Before I know I have Manfan syndrome, I had a long-term plan for my life.

SOURCED FROM CURRENT GLOBAL NEWSPAPERS AND JOURNALS

AGOO, La Union: Rep. Eufranio Eriguel (La Union, 2nd District) said that the
Congress has approved the Rare Disease Bill which provides medical and financial
support to patients with uncommon diseases in the country.
He added that the
bill also seeks to provide support, like the specialized medical personnel, and
strengthen the DOH research division, which maybe tasked to find the cure and
prevention of rare diseases.
Authored by Las Pinas Rep. Mark Villar, the rare
diseases include the Gaucher Disease, Maple Syrup Urine Disease, Pompe Disease,
Galactosemia, Phenylketonuria, Methymalonic Acidemia, Urea Cycle Defects, Hurler
Syndrome, Hunter Syndrome and Prader-Willi Syndrome.
According to the Philippine
Society for Orphan Disorders' (PSOD), there are 6,000 to 8,000 rare diseases in
the country affecting 75 percent of children population in the country.
Thirty
percent of rare disease patients die before they reach five years old, Villar
added.
The Bill defines rare disease as any health condition resulting from
genetic defects that rarely affect the general population, which are often
chronic, progressive, degenerative, and life-threatening.

In Shanghai there are more than 200,000 people suffering from rare diseases and
more than half of these patients are children.
Over 80 percent of these rare
diseases are caused by gene defects, but fewer than 5 percent can be cured or
even managed.These victims include cute 6-month-old Xiaoyu (pseudonym), who was
diagnosed with a congenital heart disease at birth.
After visiting almost all the children's hospitals in Shanghai,
physicians at the Children's Hospital of Shanghai diagnosed Xiaoyu as suffering
from Williams syndrome, a genetic condition that can cause cardiovascular
disorders, developmental delays and learning disabilities.
In this group, 30 children are also suffering from Williams syndrome
.After learning more about this disease through talking with other mothers and
studying overseas research, Xiaoyu's mother realized that some medical experts
in China would not have been able to diagnose Williams syndrome.Low incidenceAn
expert with the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning
explained: "Because rare diseases have a low incidence rate, and there is not
enough professional knowledge, misdiagnosis and delayed diagnoses happen a lot."
ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a
progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and
spinal cord.
Lou Gehrig's disease is one of the 7,000 rare diseases recognized
internationally.
The definition of a rare disease varies greatly around the
world.
A disease is defined as rare by the European Commission when it affects
fewer than 1 person in 2,000, but a disease is classified rare by the Japanese
government if it affects fewer than 1 in 2,500.The Shanghai Municipal Commission
of Health and Family Planning has defined rare diseases as diseases with a low
incidence rate, of various types and severe symptoms.
The Chinese Medical
Association defines rare diseases as diseases that affect fewer than 1 in
500,000 people or fewer than 1 in 10,000 newborn babies.
Even with these rates
there are still more than 16.8 million Chinese suffering from rare diseases.
"About 80 percent of rare diseases are caused by gene defects, but fewer than 5
percent can be cured or managed.
About 50 percent of rare diseases are present
at birth or during childhood.
The diseases develop rapidly, and the mortality
rate is high.
He has been working with the Beijing Children's
Hospital for many years and from talking to doctors, he knows that many of these
rare diseases specifically affect children.
"Many of the rare diseases are
genetic diseases.
Although there are adults who also have rare diseases, most
rare diseases are found in children," Shi told the Global Times.Although women
undergo routine tests during pregnancy, these are designed to uncover general
risks and diseases.
There are too many rare diseases to test for - to try to
rule out the possibility of rare diseases, a person would have to undergo whole
genome sequencing which is very expensive.
It would be very difficult to prevent
these rare diseases.Last year, the Children's Hospital of Shanghai discovered 70
alien genes in 42 different rare disease categories.

Not profitableFew rare disease sufferers can take medicine to treat or ease
their symptoms.
Pharmaceutical companies are not interested in undertaking
research or developing drugs for rare diseases because this is expensive and
there would not be enough people willing to pay to make these medicines
profitable.Also, because medical standards vary greatly in different provinces
and regions, the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases vary greatly.
Most
rare diseases are found in departments handling pediatrics, medical genetics,
children's endocrinology, neurology and orthopedics.
In March, the East China
Normal University and Beijing Children's Hospital launched a new medical
platform collating information on more than 3,000 rare diseases.
The platform
aims to collate cases of rare diseases.
To date in China there is still no
complete database covering all the rare diseases.
The National Health and Family
Planning Commission has set up an office for research into rare diseases, but
their database is not complete, according to Shi.
Without standardization, the cases that we
collect would be meaningless, because syndromes and treatments cannot be
compared," Shi said.
He and his research team have collected the different names
used in different institutions for every rare disease, and categorized them
under one official name.
They have also standardized the clinical symptoms of
rare diseases.
"Since each patient is different, different patients suffering
the same rare disease could show slightly different symptoms.
But the key
features of each disease are unique.
As
well as aiding research, the platform is designed to help pediatricians
throughout the country identify and treat these diseases.
"Some pediatricians
have never encountered some of the rare diseases so they cannot treat them
either.
The earlier these diseases are identified, the easier it is for doctors
to treat them," Shi said.
He hopes to find correlations between some rare
diseases and common diseases, and then find possible treatments in medicines
used to treat more common diseases.

Many problemsThere are many problems in the research and treatment of rare
diseases.
Some rural families in isolated parts of China hide the fact that
their children are suffering from a rare disease and never alert the local
authorities.And research is very expensive.
To discover why one family member
has a rare disease, researchers have to undertake whole genome sequencing of the
victim and the other siblings and parents in the family.
"In the US, people have
realized that only governments can invest in research for rare diseases, because
businesses are not willing to invest in this.
China's advantage is its huge
population and consequently some of the rare diseases do not seem so rare
anymore," said Shi.
In February the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and
Family Planning published a catalogue of the 56 major rare diseases in Shanghai.
Most of the diseases listed are endocrine and metabolic diseases, or blood and
digestive diseases.

Rare Genomics Institute Announces Winners of BeHEARD Science Challenge

LENGTH: 400  words

DATELINE: Washington


Biotechnology Industry Organization has issued the following news release:

The Rare Genomics Institute is delighted to announce the winners of the 2015
BeHEARD (Helping Empower and Accelerate Research Discoveries) challenge, a
global competition that offers rare disease researchers, who traditionally have
difficulty attracting funding, grants of the latest life science innovations and
technologies.
This unique crowdsourced competition allows many companies to
gather together to make a difference for the rare disease community.
"Over $600,000 worth of technologies were awarded to study 31 rare
diseases."
The winning proposals from BeHEARD 2015 will potentially yield key medical
research insights and help accelerate therapeutic developments for rare disease
patients.
This technology grant will allow her to
work on CODAS syndrome, a rare multi-system developmental disorder.
Another winner, Michael Harris, a parent of a Vici syndrome patient, who
received a mouse model from Taconic, said: "We are thrilled to receive this
generous award on behalf of our son and other patients suffering from Vici
syndrome.
Though it is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, this award will
hopefully lead to new therapies and a better future for Vici syndrome patients."
Rare diseases affect 300 million worldwide, yet less than five percent of the
7,000 known rare diseases have treatments available.
The BeHEARD challenge helps
non-profits, academics, advocacy groups, families of patients and for-profit
companies to collaborate in their collective mission to advance rare disease
research.
"Their knowledge, resources and selfless support are crucial in our
journey for fighting against rare diseases."

Actelion Emphasizes Commitment to Advance Research, Care in Rare Diseases

LENGTH: 602  words


Feb. 29 -- Today, on Rare Disease Day 2016, patients, their families and
caregivers, patient organizations, medical professionals, politicians and
researchers are coming together to raise awareness for what living with a rare
disease means for those affected and for their families.
Patients play a crucial role in bringing both research and the standard of care
in rare diseases forward, which is recognized in the theme of this year's Rare
Disease Day, 'Patient Voice'.
For Actelion, listening to patients' voices and
working closely with the rare disease community is key to delivering on the
company's mission to discover new innovative drugs for rare diseases and to help
more patients with groundbreaking therapies.
At the end of 2015, over 65,000
patients were benefiting from Actelion's rare disease drugs, and the company
continues to work with governments and other stakeholders to widen accessibility
around the world.
On February 23 in Brussels, our commitment to rare diseases was publicly
recognized by the European Organization for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) as Actelion
was honored with the EURORDIS Company Award 2016.
Presented to pioneering
companies for the development of treatments for rare diseases, the award in
particular acknowledges Actelion's work with patient groups to support the
patient and carer community.
Through the company's collaborative work with patient groups and healthcare
professionals, Actelion has become a trusted partner in supporting activities
that raise awareness of the challenges facing those living with rare diseases
and help bring about positive change.
Activities include the development of
educational resources such as the innovative PAHuman eBook to better explain the
disease and its impact, and the "Think Again.
Think NP-C" campaign to encourage
earlier diagnosis of Niemann-Pick type C disease among healthcare professionals
unfamiliar with this rare condition.
It's clear that Actelion's commitment extends beyond the discovery and
development of new medicines and includes initiatives that increase knowledge
and understanding of PAH and other rare diseases, which is crucial to
organizations like ours."
An example of Actelion's pioneering work in rare diseases is an ongoing clinical
study involving patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.
Working with ethics
committees, patient advocacy, support groups and patients' families, Actelion
has extended the study on Eisenmenger syndrome to Down syndrome patients, which
will help to address the high unmet medical need for effective, targeted PAH
therapies in this vulnerable and too rarely considered population.
We are turning to new
pathways in PAH, helped by our strong connections with academia, to further
improve the prognosis for patients living with this devastating disease.
Actelion also plays a leadership role in Niemann-Pick type C disease, where the
lives of many patients have been positively impacted.
I am convinced that with
our strong and innovative research, Actelion will continue to advance care in
many rare diseases."

SCIENTISTS in the North East will head a multi-million pound research programme
that could unlock the genetic faults of millions of patients with rare diseases.
Newcastle University will lead 70 research centres across Europe hoping to find
new treatments for genetic diseases such as muscular dystrophy, haemophilia and
cystic fibrosis.
Newcastle's position as a world leader - following groundbreaking research on
new genetic treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy - has seen it handed
control of the £32m EU programme.
Already scientists believe they have uncovered a breakthrough in the treatment
of the muscle-wasting disorder Duchenne.
Individual or "personalised treatment"
is being developed that could be used if clinical trials prove successful.
It is at the clinical trial stage, and if the trials show the
drug is safe and well then it can be used in treatments."
It is hoped that this will lead to faster diagnosis, better treatments and
improve the quality of life for patients.
Prof Lochmüller said: "Being able to sequence a person's entire genetic code is
an important advance, particularly for people living with the many rare genetic
disorders, but it has also shown us that sequencing is only the first part of
the story.
The International Rare Diseases Research Consortium aims to accelerate research
into rare diseases.
Scientists are bidding to reach 200 new rare disease
therapies, and diagnoses for all rare diseases, by the year 2020 with the help
of 25 funding organisations and centres from across the globe.
"All these diseases are disabling and lethal," said Prof Lochmüller.
"This research will unlock the genetic faults that cause these conditions.
Because they are so rare, we need a large-scale study across a large sample to
analyse the data."
RARE DISEASES RARE diseases - while individually uncommon - affect one person in
every 17 with around 80% of them having a genetic component.
Between 6,000 and 8,000 known rare diseases exist, and about 30 million people
across Europe are affected by a rare disease.
Prof Hans Lochmüller's research will look at the following rare diseases:
Muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, Cystic Fibrosis, spinocerebellar
ataxia, Huntington''s disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
epidermolysis bullosa, Rett syndrome, Marfan syndrome, hemochromatosis,
thalassaemia, mucopolysaccharidosis, polycystic kidney disease, Nephrotic
syndrome, haemophilia, progeria and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Misdiagnosis, lack of specialist doctors, hospital protocol - there seems to be
too many stumbling blocks in the way of identification and treatment of unusual
diseases in HK.
Lau suffers from Marfan syndrome, a rare disease caused by a genetic mutation
that weakens the body's connective tissue.
Hong Kong maintains no official
record of people detected with Marfan syndrome.
Doctors know little of the
disease.
There are no special facilities for patients suffering from the rare
disease.
"Hong Kong attaches the least importance to genetic diseases, or the so-called
rare diseases, compared to other economies.
No special measures have been
implemented, even for the detection of rare diseases," says Lam Ching-wan,
clinical professor at the Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing (LKS) Faculty of
Medicine at the University of Hong Kong.
Lam has been researching rare diseases
for more than 20 years.
And do you have a family history of heart diseases?"
"Then the doctor gave me his diagnosis - gastro-esophageal reflux disease
(GERD)," says Lau.
GERD is a disease of the stomach which can cause severe chest
pains.
Diagnosis errors

"The chance of misdiagnosis in rare diseases could be more than 80 percent," Lam
said, citing his own research data.
"That definitely affects patients' health.
Doctors later concluded Larson died from undiagnosed Marfan
syndrome.
Doctors suspected it was Marfan syndrome but couldn't be positive without
further examination.
Marfan syndrome requires a gene test to establish a
definitive diagnosis.
A hazy area

The Marfan Syndrome Association in Hong Kong states that one in 5,000 people
have the syndrome, citing statistics published by the National Marfan Foundation
in the United States.
The city does not have a database of statistics nor an official definition of
the about 6,000 other rare diseases identified globally.
According to the World Health Organization, in every 10,000 people, 6.5 to 10
suffer from rare diseases.
That implies that in Hong Kong about 45 newborn
infants every year are born with a rare disease, extrapolated from births
averaging 45,000 per year, says Lam, the pathologist from the University of Hong
Kong.
Some patients may die before they are
diagnosed... 150 to 200 rare diseases have been diagnosed in Hong Kong but the
actual number is higher.
Doctors who are
not specialized in genetics have difficulty verifying rare diseases."
"The courses taught in medical schools cover only the most common
diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.
It all depends on
whether or not a doctor has knowledge of rare diseases (related to the
symptoms)," Lam added.
Only six medicines for four kinds of rare diseases are listed on the Hospital
Authority Drug Formulary.
Taiwan, however, has identified 204 rare diseases and established
specific definitions for them.
Taiwan provides 85 medicines for about 1,000
rare-disease-afflicted patients as of December 2014.
Due to the lack of market demand and because of the prolonged research and
development phase, private pharmaceutical companies seem to be disinterested in
producing medicines for rare diseases.
"Only if the team confirms that the medicine will benefit a patient in a
specific stage of the disease in an obvious way will they authorize that
medicine," said Lam.
New rights group

The last day of February is marked as International Rare Diseases Day.
The Hong
Kong Alliance for Rare Diseases was established on that day this year, with a
mission to urge the government to protect the human rights of this largely
unrepresented group.
"Early detection and even early diagnosis are significant to a patient of rare
disease.
Lam says an undiagnosed disease program at the medical school of the University
of Hong Kong, has been providing clinical help to patients with rare diseases
since November 2014, on a two-year grant from the S.K.
"Before I know I have Manfan syndrome, I had a long-term plan for my life.

Laurinburg vigil planned for rare diseases

Feb. 26--LAURINBURG -- Chaka Davis Smith was totally in the dark about Jeune
Syndrome when a doctor diagnosed her two-year-old son Tristan Brown with the
rare disease in 2010 -- the only person in the state diagnosed with the disease
that year.
Some seven years later, the Tristan Brown ABC's of Rare Diseases Foundation will
hold its annual candlelight vigil Tuesday to raise awareness about that illness
and other rare diseases.
Earlier this week, Laurinburg Mayor Matthew Block signed a proclamation to
recognize Rare Disease Day in the city.
As part of National Rare Disease Day, the vigil will be held at 6 p.m. at the
James Lot, 333 Main Street, in Laurinburg.
Even though it's a rare condition, Smith said she found comfort in other
families who were going through the same turmoil.
Jeune Syndrome is estimated to
occur in one out of every 100,000-130,000 live births among all ethnic
populations.
Jeune Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the way a child's cartilage
and bones develop particularly the rib cage, pelvis, arms and legs.
The disease
also attacks the child's kidneys which over time results in renal failure.
"To experience the challenges of a child with a rare condition is heartbreaking
because you do not know how the child is feeling," she said.
"To meet families
of children with rare conditions while being in the hospital, gave a sense of
comfort and you can relate to situations.
Essie Davis, started The Tristan Brown ABC's
of Rare Diseases Foundation.
"I begin this foundation with my faith in God to help families who have children
with rare conditions, who have long stays in the hospital and need shelter such
as the Ronald McDonald House," Smith said.

Rachel Martin underwent emergency heart surgery after a miracle saved her life

A woman who suffers from a rare genetic condition has told how doctors saved her
life by diagnosing her at a conference.
Rachel Martin, 35, from Limerick, was born with congenital muscle problems and
had always been told that she suffered from Marfan Syndrome.
But while at a conference in America to discover more about her illness, Rachel
was told that she had a different condition and needed emergency life-saving
surgery on her heart.
Rachel said: "I was clinically diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome as I have quite a
few of the clinical attributes of the condition but I don't fit the criteria
properly.
"I went to a Marfan conference in Boston in 2008 and I was very fortunate to
meet experts there who were able to tell me that actually I didn't have Marfan
Syndrome but another similar condition called Loeys-Dietz Syndrome."
Rachel said: "In the same breath that those doctors told me I had Loeys-Dietz
Syndrome, I was told I needed to get home and have aortic surgery and waste no
more time.
Rachel was telling her story as part of International Rare Disease Day where
experts called on the next Government to radically overhaul genetic services in
Ireland and to ramp up implementation of the National Rare Disease Plan.
There are over 6,000 rare diseases in existence in Ireland affecting
300,000-plus children and adults.
Around 80 per cent of these patients are affected by just 350 rare diseases.
Philip Watt, chair of the Rare Disease Task Force, said genetic disease services
here are under-resourced.
He said: "The National Rare Disease Plan was launched in July 2014, yet almost
two years on, many of its recommendations remain to be implemented.

"The resourcing of clinical genetics services in Ireland is fundamental to the
diagnosis, care and treatment of people with rare diseases.
"Without access to genetic services, diagnosis is severely delayed preventing
access to appropriate ongoing referrals for management and treatment, and vital
support services."

working too many hours

Avril Daly, Chair of the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation, said there
were many others out there like Rachel who were suffering because of lack of
proper genetic diagnosis.
She said: "In real terms delays in diagnosis mean that a patient may go past the
point where a treatment can be impactful for them and, if there is no genetic
diagnosis at all, they are unaware of their treatment options.
International Rare Disease Day is co-ordinated by EURORDIS, a European alliance
of patient organisations, and takes place in more than 80 countries around the
globe.

'Need for policy on rare disorders'

Hunter syndrome and Hurler syndrome these are the diseases which

affect one person in two lakh, but the patients and their kins suffer since
diagnosis is difficult due to lack of medication, awareness and symptoms that
are similar to ear infections, runny noses, and cold.
City's doctors to mark the

mark the 'International Rare disease Day' on Sunday discussed the issue of
patients afflicted with rare diseases and concluded that government should come
up with a national policy on this matter.
"There are 7,000 rare diseases and in
India alone 70 million people have been affected by rare disease.
This means that one out of every 20 persons is affected with rare disease," Dr
Jayesh Sheth, expert in Genetics and Endocrinology, said.
"In 80% of the cases
the origin of such diseases are genetic hence chances of recurrence within the
family is 25% to 50%.
Since these diseases are rare pharmaceutical companies do
not see much financial gain and are not interested in developing drugs Sheth
added.

Filipinos with rare ailments seek gov't help

They stand no more than three feet and look remarkably alikesame coarse facial
features, short neck and fisted hands.
The three suffer from Hunter syndrome, a rare and
serious genetic disorder that strikes when an enzyme the body needs is missing
or is not working properly.
The disease primarily affects males.
Apart from changes in facial and anatomical features and stunted growth, people
with Hunter syndrome suffer from mental retardation, progressive hearing loss
and thickening of the heart valves leading to a decline in cardiac function,
obstructive airway disease and enlargement of the liver and spleen.
Improve quality of life

"Just like other Filipinos suffering from a rare disease, the siblings need
continuous access to therapies that could improve their quality of life.
At the
moment this is next to impossible given the fact that little is known about rare
diseases.
There are very few specific treatments available and when there are,
they are very expensive and thus out of reach of the majority of patients," said
Cynthia Magdaraog, president of the Philippine Society for Orphan Disorders
(PSOD), a nonprofit organization founded in 2006.
Magdaraog explained that a disease or disorder is considered rare if it affects
one in 20,000 individuals, as defined by the Institute of Human Genetics of the
National Institutes of Health, University of the Philippines Manila.
In the case of Hunter syndrome, around 2,000 people worldwide have been known to
have this disease, with about 20 recorded in the Philippines.
On Feb. 28, the world marked the Rare Disease Day, an annual observance that
started in 2007 to raise awareness of rare diseases, increase international
cooperation in the field of clinical and scientific research, and share
scientific knowledge on all rare diseases.
Rare Disease Act

In the Philippines, families and doctors of patients with rare disease are
hoping for the passage of the "Rare Disease Act of 2014," which calls on the
government to make sure that persons with rare diseases will be given access to
medical treatment and drugs.
Hunter syndrome is just one of the more than 7,000 different types of rare
diseases.
Unfortunately, its cure has yet to be discovered and current treatments
available are just meant to slow the disease's progress and to lessen its
severity.
"Just because a disease is rare doesn't mean it should be disregarded.
According to Magdaraog, who has a 33yearold son suffering from a neuromuscular
disorder called Pompe disease, PSOD has been relentlessly sourcing funds from
foreign and local donors.
The group has arranged with drug companies to make available special food
formulas, medication and enzyme replacement therapies crucial to sustaining and
improving the health of patients with a rare disease.
"I know from experience the challenges they face, because I cared for and lost
my youngest son due to complications from a rare congenital disease called
trisomy 13," said Sen. Pia Cayetano in a privilege speech on Feb. 25.
Other children affected with rare
diseases do not share the same situation as the Parco brothers, who have been
fortunate enough to receive help and support to sustain the maintenance drugs
they need," said Cayetano, who raised the need to fund healthcare and assistance
for raredisease patients during a recent budget deliberation for the Department
of Health (DOH), proposing that P100 million be taken from the proceeds of the
sin tax for this purpose.
Cayetano said the committee report for the rare disease bill was being finalized
and would be filed soon.
10351 or the Sin Tax Reform Act to health services for patients with rare
diseases but will also designate the DOH to establish a National Rare Disease
Registry, which will include an inventory of rare diseases in the country,
information on diagnosed patients, and a list of certified medicines and medical
devices.

Regulus Initiates Phase I Clinical Study of RG-012, microRNA Therapeutic in
Development for Treatment of Alport Syndrome

LENGTH: 556  words


June 4 -- Regulus Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: RGLS), a biopharmaceutical company
leading the discovery and development of innovative medicines targeting
microRNAs, announced today that dosing has begun in a first-in-human Phase I
clinical study of RG-012, a single stranded, chemically modified oligonucleotide
that binds to and inhibits the function of microRNA-21 ("miR-21").
RG-012 is
being developed by Regulus in a strategic alliance with Genzyme, a Sanofi
company, for the treatment of Alport syndrome, a life-threatening genetic kidney
disease with no approved therapy.
"Advancement of RG-012 into the clinic represents an important achievement under
our 'Clinical Map Initiative' and further underscores our focus on discovering
and developing novel microRNA therapies for orphan and rare diseases such as
Alport syndrome," said Paul Grint, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer
of Regulus.
"We expect that the results from this first-in-human clinical study
of RG-012, combined with our learnings from our natural history of disease study
called ATHENA, will provide the clinical basis for the design of a
proof-of-concept study to monitor the therapeutic effect of RG-012 in Alport
syndrome patients."
Seng Cheng, Ph.D., Head of Research and Early Development of Rare Diseases at
Genzyme, a Sanofi company, added, "MicroRNA therapeutics represent a novel and
exciting new approach for the treatment of rare diseases and the progress made
by Regulus represents a significant milestone for patients with Alport syndrome,
a devastating and debilitating disease.
There are few therapeutic treatment
options for patients with Alport syndrome and we believe that RG-012 entering
the clinic represents an opportunity to make a significant step forward.
With
the initiation of this study, Genzyme is excited to continue its leadership in
rare diseases and commitment to innovation for diseases with unmet medical
need."
In addition to the Phase I clinical study, Regulus is currently enrolling Alport
syndrome patients in a natural history of disease study called ATHENA.
With
this study, which has thirteen clinical sites worldwide, Regulus aims to learn
more about the changes in renal function over time in patients with Alport
syndrome.
Data from the ATHENA study will provide the clinical basis for the
design of a Phase II study to monitor the therapeutic effect of RG-012 on the
decline in renal function and time to end-stage renal disease in Alport syndrome
patients.
In addition, Regulus expects that many patients enrolled in ATHENA
will be eligible to enroll in a Phase II proof-of-concept study, which Regulus
expects to initiate under its 'Clinical Map Initiative' following the conclusion
of the Phase I clinical study announced today.

Eight-year-old Palmer Douglas was a toddler when he was diagnosed with a
life-threatening disorder so rare that only about 250 cases have been identified
worldwide.
Against unbelievable odds, both his parents, Randy and Kim, carry a copy of an
extremely rare recessive gene that causes Alström syndrome.
Palmer inherited
both copies, and as a result he is prone to obesity and susceptible to diabetes,
heart and kidney failure and liver disease.
Some with this disease die in their
teens or early adulthood; most progressively lose their vision through their
childhood.
A significant number of the estimated 6,000 rare diseases
affect children, and many, like Alström syndrome, involve more than one system
in the body.
While a seriously ill child is every
parent's nightmare, coping with a rare disease has unique challenges.
The Douglas family was fortunate in that Palmer was diagnosed when he was two,
but they've met families who didn't know their children had Alström syndrome
until they were teenagers.
(They had another child before they found out they
were carriers, but Charles, now 7, didn't get the genes that cause the disease.)
But other families of children with rare diseases are in limbo for years waiting
for a diagnosis.
Kim Cornish, a McGill University researcher, is an expert in several rare
genetic disorders that cause mental retardation in children, including fragile X
syndrome.
"When it comes to less well-known
syndromes, parents can get quite a raw deal," she says.
Many rare disorders that affect children have their own behavioural quirks.
Children with Angelman syndrome, for example, have trouble talking and have
prolonged paroxysms of inappropriate laughter.
Mr. Douglas's way of dealing with his son's illness was to reach out to other
parents of children with Alström syndrome.
He helped organize an international
conference, raised money and founded Alström Syndrome Canada, a registered
charity.
He also reached out to families across the country with other rare disorders,
becoming the president the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders, or CORD.
With only 10 families in Canada affected by Alström syndrome, there is little
chance they can solve many of the problems that face people with rare disorders.
But if they join forces with the estimated three million Canadians who suffer
from rare diseases, Mr. Douglas says they could become a force that politicians
and policy-makers would have a harder time ignoring.
New
legislation to encourage research into new drugs for orphan diseases is
essential, and Canada lags behind the United States and other countries on this.
Patients also need a way to find doctors familiar with their disease.
Some sort
of national centre or clinic for people with rare disorders would be a good
first step, she says.
In her case, it took 30 years before doctors determined she had Ehlers-Danlos, a
disease characterized by fragile connective tissue that has left her with severe
gastrointestinal problems.
Ms. Gaetz-Faubert says her daughter is slowly being weaned from
the inhaled steroids she has been taking since she was a toddler, but doctors
have no idea what the next step in her treatment will be.
She doesn't know any
other people with the syndrome who have similar symptoms.
Four-part seriesAs many as three million Canadians suffer from an estimated
6,000 rare diseases.
In a feature on each Health page this week, The Globe and
Mail looks at the difficulties these patients face.
The
isolation of having a disease no one has ever heard of.

MPP pushing for provincial funding for obscure diseases

BYLINE: Carmela Fragomeni The Hamilton Spectator

SECTION: LOCAL / NEWS; Pg.
Maybe someday, something can be
done about her seven-year-old son Thomas' Dravet Syndrome, a severe form of
epilepsy.
Fournier was among 46 people with rare disease experience who met in Hamilton
Tuesday with Kitchener-Conestoga Progressive Conservative MPP Michael Harris -
who is touring Ontario with his fight for provincial funding for rare diseases
treatments.
Harris, at the Scleroderma Society for his Hamilton visit, said he's introducing
a private members' motion to create an all-party select committee for rare
disease treatment funding.
"It's important we tackle this issue (rare diseases
treatment funding)..."

Harris heard from sufferers of rare illnesses such as Angelman Syndrome, Tarlov
Cyst Disease, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Phenylketonuria Disorder (PKU),
Scleroderma, and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).
Harris acknowledges some say it's too expensive to treat them, but says, "The
minute your child is diagnosed with a rare disease, that tune changes.
Fournier, of Burlington, said afterwards, "When you have a child with a rare,
catastrophic condition, you feel helpless.
"We definitely need more awareness raised as well as treatment options ... and I
am confident the #TreatRareDisease campaign will help achieve this.
Francis Grove of Ajax, who has had PKU since birth, said a new treatment costs
$70,000 a year but it is not accessible.
Sarah Hall, 14, of Hamilton, said her rare Complex Regional Pain Syndrome
(CRPS), which can be triggered by as much as a light touch, "is known as the
suicide disease because too many people can't take the constant feeling of pain,
pain like someone is stabbing you with a knife ..."

Care in the United States costs at least $40,000 US, but Hall hopes OHIP will
approve coverage, and she urged Harris to move quickly.

Jessica Fournier finally has a spark of hope.
Maybe someday, something can be
done about her seven-year-old son Thomas' Dravet Syndrome, a severe form of
epilepsy.
Fournier was among 46 people with rare disease experience who met in Hamilton
Tuesday with Kitchener-Conestoga Progressive Conservative MPP Michael Harris -
who is touring Ontario with his fight for provincial funding for rare diseases
treatments.
Harris, at the Scleroderma Society for his Hamilton visit, said he's introducing
a private members' motion to create an all-party select committee for rare
disease treatment funding.
"It's important we tackle this issue (rare diseases
treatment funding)..."

Harris heard from sufferers of rare illnesses such as Angelman Syndrome, Tarlov
Cyst Disease, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Phenylketonuria Disorder (PKU),
Scleroderma, and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).
Harris acknowledges some say it's too expensive to treat them, but says "The
minute your child is diagnosed with a rare disease, that tune changes.
Fournier, of Burlington, said afterwards, "When you have a child with a rare,
catastrophic condition, you feel helpless.
"We definitely need more awareness raised as well as treatment options ... and I
am confident the #TreatRareDisease campaign will help achieve this.
Francis Grove of Ajax, who has had PKU since birth said a new treatment costs
$70,000 a year but it is not accessible.
Sarah Hall, 14, of Hamilton, said her rare Complex Regional Pain Syndrome
(CRPS), which can be triggered by as much as a light touch, "is known as the
suicide disease because too many people can't take the constant feeling of pain,
pain like someone is stabbing you with a knife..."

Care in the United States costs at least $40,000 US, but Hall hopes OHIP will
approve coverage, and she urged Harris to move quickly.

Laurinburg hosts rare disease vigil

March 02--LAURINBURG -- A group of about two dozen Scotland County residents
came together this week to celebrate Rare Disease Day.
The candlelight vigil is meant to raise awareness for the hundreds of diseases
that are too atypical to have their own day or month, unlike common disease like
heart disease or breast cancer.
Rare Disease Day -- recognized internationally -- was started in 2008 and
originally was on Feb. 29, the rarest date of all, which only falls on leap
years.
The local event was organized by the Tristan Brown ABC's of Rare Disease
Foundation and held on the corner of Church and Main streets to show support and
pray for those who live with a rare condition or have passed.
The local foundation was founded by Chaka Davis Smith, who's son, Tristan Brown,
passed away from Jeune Syndrome, one of the world's rarest disease, in 2012.
"I have immediate family, church family and community family who have come out
to honor Tristan and Rare disease day,' said Smith.
Tuesday's Rare Disease Day vigil follows Brown's birthday -- he would have
turned 9 years old on Monday.
Laurinburg Mayor Matthew Block signed a proclamation to recognize Rare Disease
Day in the city, and also attended the vigil, along with family and friends of
Smith, as well as community members.
"I'm here to show my support for people who suffer from rare diseases," Block
said.
"I deal with probably the most common disease, the common disease of heart
disease happens to so many people it has a lot of advocacy and in fact it gets
the whole month of February to be recognized."
Smith was totally in the dark about Jeune Syndrome when a doctor diagnosed her
two-year-old son with the rare disease in 2010 -- the only person in the state
diagnosed with the disease that year.
Seven years later, the Tristan Brown ABC's of Rare Diseases Foundation held its
5th annual candlelight vigil to raise awareness about that illness and other
rare diseases.
Smith and her foundation have also looked to the community for donations to help
raise money for others dealing with rare diseases to take their children to the
Ronald McDonald Houses in Chapel Hill, Durham and Ann Arbor, MI.
"I begin this foundation with my faith in God to help families who have children
with rare conditions, who have long stays in the hospital and need shelter such
as the Ronald McDonald House," Smith said.
Jeune Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the way a child's cartilage
and bones develop particularly the rib cage, pelvis, arms and legs.
The disease
also attacks the child's kidneys which over time results in renal failure.
"Over the past few years, this vigil has helped raise awareness to rare diseases
-- a lot of my coworkers will say they know someone with a rare disease and this
event helps is raising that awareness," Smith said.

Exhibition celebrates our differences

Each child has been diagnosed with a rare disease.
The images were taken by mum Ceredwin Hughes, whose son Isaac has the rare
genetic disease Moebius.
His condition results in paralysis of facial nerves, and while his family could
easily see changes in his expressions others were unable to.
Ceridwen sought to capture Isaac's personality photographically herself and her
success led her to create Same But Different and The Rare Project, featuring
many young people and children with rare diseases.
Ceridwen has worked with several families over the last 12 months to build a
gallery of images that really capture the person behind each rare condition.
Same But Different, a not for profit organisation, will launch The Rare Project
using photography to showcase the work, which is hoped will highlight the
obstacles the children and their families face.
"Isaac loves to tease and make fun of his friends - even though he was born with
a condition that means he can't smile," said Ceridwen.
"The Rare Project encourages people to get to know young people and children
with rare diseases for their personalities and not their condition," said his
mum.
"It's vitally important that we break down barriers and empower people to have a
voice so the people behind rare diseases can be seen.
People often make
judgements based on the superficial and I wanted to help people look past the
conditions and see the person behind that.
"Rare diseases affect one in 17 people in the UK.
They are far more common than
many people imagine and so the project also hopes to raise awareness of the
6,000-8,000 rare diseases that exist," she added.
"The charity Findacure defines many rare diseases as 'fundamental diseases'.
For
example the research into a rare condition such as Prader-Willi syndrome, which
affects appetite and diet, is a doorway to informing understanding of common
conditions such as obesity and diabetes."
Same But Different has recently partnered with Climb, a charity supporting
families affected by over 700 Inherited Metabolic Diseases (IMDs) making up a
large proportion of rare diseases.
She has Leigh's disease, a condition of the
central nervous system.
Despite her condition Alex doesn't let it stop her from travelling to Florida to
visit Disneyworld and her favourite characters Mickey, Minnie and Jimini
Cricket.
He has Crouzon syndrome,
a condition where skull bones fuse prematurely.
Crouzon syndrome hasn't got in the way of Matthew's love of football and he
hopes to play for Real Madrid or Manchester United.

Around 60,000 people in Cyprus suffer from a rare disease

LENGTH: 337 words


At least 60,000 people in Cyprus suffer from rare diseases, among the 30 million
across Europe who are similarly afflicted, it emerged on Sunday.
The figures were released by National Committee for Rare Diseases a the health
ministry .a day ahead of 'Rare Disease Day' on Monday.
It is estimated that
there are 6,000 to 8,000 different rare diseases in the world.
The committee said most rare diseases are genetic and include congenital
abnormalities in growth, chromosomal monogenic syndromes, skeletal
malformations, hereditary metabolic diseases, and hereditary cancers.
There are
also rare autoimmune diseases and childhood cancers.
it said people with diseases lose the most productive years of their lives and
hence need timely and accurate diagnosis, multidisciplinary care and
comprehensive treatment.
In Cyprus, through systematic work by health professionals, scientists,
representatives of patients and other experts, a national strategy has been
prepared to combat the phenomenon, the committee said.
Volunteer Commissioner Yiannis Yiannaki, referring to this year's campaign
slogan 'The Voice of Patients' said the aim was to achieve the changes necessary
to improve the lives of patients and their families and carers.
After the rare diseases noted in Cyprus are congenital heart defects, genetic
neurological diseases, myopathies, metabolic syndromes, skeletal malformations,
and rare diseases in the thalassaemia sector.
Yiannaki did concede that it was
generally recognised that there are gaps in the provision of health care to
those patients with rare diseases.
The campaign this year, he added, aims to strengthen the voice of these patients
and raise society's awareness, and that of health professionals regarding rare
diseases.
There were, he said NGOs active abroad and in Cyprus that encourage
patients to demand equal opportunities in access to health care.
The post Around 60,000 people in Cyprus suffer from a rare disease appeared
first on Cyprus Mail.

Patients 'wait up to 10 years for rare disease diagnosis';
SURVEY 'REVEALS NEED FOR A CO-ORDINATED PLAN'

PATIENTS with rare diseases are waiting up to 10 years for an accurate
diagnosis, a report today reveals.
Rare Disease UK said many patients are facing years of unnecessary delays.
The organisation's report, Experiences of Rare Diseases, based on a survey of
600 patients, said almost half were initially misdiagnosed.
Only a quarter of those asked were diagnosed within three months of the onset of
symptoms but almost one in five lived with conditions for more than five years
before receiving an accurate diagnosis.
Alastair Kent, chair of Rare Disease UK (RDUK), said: "Many people living with
rare diseases and their families have to go through years of medical tests and
procedures before an accurate diagnosis can be made.
"Not only is it often a battle to get an accurate diagnosis, patients and
families then struggle to find out the medical impact of a condition and how to
manage it, on top of having to cope with day-to-day life without adequate
support.
"The results of RDUK's survey hammer home the need for a co-ordinated national
plan for the diagnosis, treatment and research of rare diseases.
"This is a
hugely important issue that needs to be tackled - patients and families should
not have to face an inequitable level of care from the NHS because they have the
misfortune of their condition being rare."
A rare disease is defined as one that affects about one in 2,000 people.
Collectively, rare diseases are relatively common - 3.5 million people in the UK
live with a rare condition at some point in their lives, the equivalent to one
person in 17.
They include muscular dystrophy, all childhood cancers and conditions such as
Lowe syndrome, Cockayne syndrome and multiple endocrine neoplasia, also known as
Men.
The RDUK report revealed the "traumatic" experience of getting a diagnosis
for many patients - almost a third received more than three incorrect diagnoses
before being accurately diagnosed.
The Western Mail earlier this year featured the Thomases' ultimately successful
fight to receive the drug mozobil, which would help the 49-year-old to produce
sufficient stem cells for a transplant to keep the disease in remission.

Vigil to raise awareness of rare disease

Feb. 25--LAURINBURG -- On Friday evening, Chaka Davis will mark what would have
been her son's sixth birthday with a public candlelight vigil, held to raise
awareness of the rare disease that took his young life.
Davis, the founder of the "Tristan Brown ABCs of Rare Diseases Foundation," is
organizing the vigil, set for 5:45 p.m. at the A.B.
Laurinburg Mayor Pro Tem Mary Jo Adams, with Chaka, her mother Essie
Davis and Tristan's aunt Willie M. Hayes looking on, signed a proclamation
earlier this month declaring February 22-27 as Rare Disease Week.
"All we want to do is share information about rare diseases," Davis said.
"It's
amazing how rare some of these diseases are, some of them so much so that you
would never have heard anything about them."
Such is the case with Davis, who had never heard of Jeune Syndrome before her
son was diagnosed, the only child in the state with the disease at that time.
Jeune Syndrome affects lungs and kidneys, leading Tristan to have to undergo
several surgeries, including the installation of titanium ribs to reinforce his
chest wall.
Diseases are defined as rare when they affect fewer than 200,000 people, or
fewer than 1 in 1,500, in the U.S. at any given time.
There are approximately
7,000 known rare diseases.
Davis' foundation partners with the Global Genes Project and she is an
ambassador for National Organization of Rare Disorders.
All three organizations
promote awareness of and advocate for individuals with rare diseases in the hope
that with awareness, medical practitioners will be better able to diagnose and
treat them.

These enchanting images of children form part of new photographic exhibition
which celebrates difference.
Each child has been diagnosed with a rare disease.
The images were taken by mum Ceredwin Hughes, whose son Isaac has the rare
genetic disease Moebius.
His condition results in paralysis of facial nerves, and while his family could
easily see changes in his expressions others were unable to.
Ceridwen sought to capture Isaac's personality photographically herself and her
success led her to create Same But Different and The Rare Project, featuring
many young people and children with rare diseases.
Ceridwen has worked with several families over the last 12 months to build a
gallery of images that really capture the person behind each rare condition.
Same But Different, a not for profit organisation, will launch The Rare Project'
using photography to showcase the work, which is hoped will highlight the
obstacles the children and their families face.
"Isaac loves to tease and make fun of his friends - even though he was born with
a condition that means he can't smile," mum-of-two Ceridwen, from Mold, said.
"The Rare Project encourages people to get to know young people and children
with rare diseases for their personalities and not their condition," said his
mum.
"It's vitally important that we break down barriers and empower people to have a
voice so the people behind rare diseases can be seen.
"People often make judgements based on the superficial and I wanted to help
people look past the conditions and see the person behind that.
"Rare diseases affect one in 17 people in the UK.
They are far more common than
many people imagine and so the project also hopes to raise awareness of the
6000-8000 rare diseases that exist," she added.

"The charity Findacure defines many rare diseases as 'fundamental diseases'.
For
example the research into a rare condition such as Prader-Willi syndrome, which
affects appetite and diet, is a doorway to informing understanding of common
conditions such as obesity and diabetes."
Same But Different has recently partnered with Climb, a charity supporting
families affected by over 700 Inherited Metabolic Diseases (IMDs) making up a
large proportion of rare diseases.
She

 THE mother of a four-year-old child with a rare disease which causes the boy's
hands to grow out of proportion to his tiny body is pleading for help as her
son's condition worsens.
The boy was born with Proteus syndrome in Victoria Hospital in Alice in 2008.
Proteus syndrome, also known as Wiedemann syndrome, is a congenital disorder
that causes skin overgrowth and atypical bone development, often accompanied by
tumours.
Department of health provincial spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said in cases of rare
diseases an assessment had to be conducted by doctors with a possible referral
to the Red Cross Children's Hospital.

Penn Orphan Disease Center to Develop Rare Disease Patient Registries

LENGTH: 427  words


May 31 -- The Orphan Disease Center in the Perelman School of Medicine at the
University of Pennsylvania will collaborate with Pulse Infoframe Inc., a medical
informatics company, to develop rare disease patient registries aimed at
enabling international collaboration to better understand these diseases, as
well as accelerate and improve clinical studies to develop new therapies.
"Our aim is to unite the respective rare disease patient, foundation, pharma,
biotech, and academic communities to overcome common obstacles in the process of
developing new therapies for rare diseases," said Ashley Winslow, PhD, senior
director of the Orphan Disease Center (ODC) at Penn Medicine.
"By building a
strong foundation that facilitates communication between different communities
of people with rare diseases, we have a unique opportunity to change the way
patient communities can participate in research.
We are building a global
database that is very different from current databases built by an individual
disease expert or lab."
The collaboration will begin with registries for CDKL5 Deficiency and
Crigler-Najjar syndrome.
Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a congenital familial disorder in which
glucuronyl transferase, an enzyme, is deficient or absent.
The condition is
characterized by nonhemolytic jaundice, an accumulation of bilirubin in the
blood, and severe disorders of the central nervous system.
"Natural history data are essential in establishing best clinical practices and
conducting pivotal clinical trials in rare diseases," said James M. Wilson, MD,
PhD, director of the Orphan Disease Center and a professor of Medicine and
Pediatrics at Penn Medicine.
"This partnership will help us address this
important gap for CDKL5 deficiency and Crigler-Najjar syndrome, which are the
first of many registries that the Orphan Disease Center will develop in
collaboration with Pulse Infoframe."
"The Orphan Disease Center's commitment to empowering the patient voice globally
represents a tremendous opportunity to intercept disease-causing processes as we
learn more about each condition," said Femida Gwadry-Sridhar, RPh, PhD, Pulse
Infoframe founder and CEO.

New York: Mount Sinai a Lead Site in NIH-Funded Rare Diseases Consortium
Studying Autism and Intellectual Disability

LENGTH: 903  words

DATELINE: Albany


Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sina, The State of New York has issued the
following News release:

Under a five-year, $6 million grant from the National Institutes of Health's
(NIH) Rare Disease Clinical Research Network, the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai (ISMMS) will serve as one of 10 medical centers that have formed the
Developmental Synaptopathies Consortium (DSC).
The consortium will study three
rare, genetic syndromes that often cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and
intellectual disability (ID).
While both ASD and ID have a variety of know genetic causes, the three
conditions to be studied by the DSC - tuberous sclerosis complex (caused by
mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes), Phelan-McDermid syndrome (caused by
SHANK3 mutations) and PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (caused by PTEN mutations) -
seem to affect certain shared cellular pathways that influence the development
of synapses, the spaces between nerve cells in pathways that "decide" whether
signals travel onward to create healthy brain connections.
The consortium seeks to distinguish the neurobehavioral characteristics of these
rare syndromes.
Researchers will also track the natural history of the syndromes
to identify demographic, environmental and other variables that correlate with
disease outcomes, which may enable the development of mechanism-based therapies
for ASD and ID.
The Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at ISMMS will lead the study
of Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), an autism-related syndrome that is typically
caused by a defect in the SHANK3 gene.
"Through the consortium, we can tackle challenges common to rare diseases like
Phelan-McDermid syndrome, including widely dispersed patient populations and
scientific experts, difficulty in diagnosis and the lack of data from natural
history studies," says Alex Kolevzon, PhD, Clinical Director of the Seaver
Autism Center and principal investigator of the Phelan-McDermid syndrome
consortium.
Phelan-McDermid syndrome is associated with intellectual disabilities, sleep
disorders, seizures, behavioral issues, functional language delays, low muscle
tone, poor motor control and problems with eating.
Like other autism-related
syndromes, severity of symptoms varies widely.
Together, the sites seek to enroll 100 patients with tuberous sclerosis, 90 with
Phelan-McDermid syndrome and 140 with PTEN mutations, ages 3 to 21, and follow
them for three to five years with physical examinations, neuropsychological
testing and advanced brain imaging.
"While it's very unlikely that a single therapy
could treat disorders with so many distinct causes, we may be able to find
certain groups of patients who share defects in similar biochemical pathways who
may respond to treatment with the same agents."
"I am excited to co-direct this consortium because of the opportunity to look at
rare single gene causes of autism and developmental delay," says Joseph Buxbaum,
PhD, Director of the Seaver Autism Center and Administrative Director of the
Consortium.
A deeper
understanding of the shared biological underpinnings of these rare diseases may
also serve as a window to our understanding of the broader mechanisms of ASD and
ID."
The Center strives to develop innovative diagnostics
and treatments for integration into the provision of personalized, comprehensive
assessment and care for people with ASD.

Family coping with baby's rare disease ; Flagler family struggles to cope with
baby's rare breathing disorder

PALM COAST -- Lyra Havlin turned 2 months old on Nov. 5 but she has yet to leave
the neonatal intensive care unit of Wolfson Children's Hospital in Jacksonville.
Lyra, a twin, was born with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, or
CCHS, an extremely rare disease of the central nervous system in which the
automatic control of breathing is absent or impaired.
Still, it took four weeks before Zierk and Havlin had a firm diagnosis, mostly
because CCHS is such a rare disease.
According to the American Thoracic Society,
only some 1,000 people worldwide are known to be affected by the syndrome.
The
condition is even rarer in twins.
"The chances are one in 200,000 of contracting this disease," Ingyinn said.
Because of the rarity of the syndrome, she said, "we don't have the numbers to
do studies."
According to Lois Lander, an information specialist at the National Institutes
of Health's Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, CCHS is not hereditary
but caused by a genetic mutation that could be passed on if Lyra eventually has
children.
Ingyinn said genetic testing within the past decade has improved the ability to
diagnose CCHS, and previous cases of CCHS may have been misdiagnosed as Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome.
"Because it's so rare, doctors and nurses don't know to
look for it."
She said her condition, which
doctors told her was caused by a fluid buildup due to the pregnancy, has been
resolved with medication.
The American Thoracic Society reports that CCHS is incurable but can be managed
and patients can grow and have reasonably normal lives.
A Wolfson representative said the hospital
treats patients regardless of their ability to pay.

Washington: PROGRAMMING ALERT: TLC Show Showcases Rare Diseases and the Patients
Fighting Them

LENGTH: 640 words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington, DC: Energy & Commerce Committee United States House of
Representatives  has issued the following press release:



 "My wish is to meet someone that knows how I feel," says seven-year-old
Giovanni (in the orange shirt above) who has the rare disease Schwartz-Jampel
syndrome.
Making that connection for rare disease patients is the premise of the
new TLC network program, "Two in A Million."
Stemming
from watching an award-winning student film about a young boy with
Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, Adam Hawkins, senior vice president of development at
Raw, and his colleagues wondered what life would be like for the young boy if he
ever met someone else who had the same rare disease - or on the flip side, what
his life would be like having never met another person with the disease.
According to CNN, each
episode will pair two people with the same disease, where they will then "spend
one week together sharing hardships and incredible triumphs, visiting
world-renowned doctors and finding answers to important questions."
Having a rare disease can be very lonely for patients, which makes finding a
community and sharing experiences critical, for both social interaction as well
as medical treatment.
The 21st Century Cures effort seeks to foster the sense of community among
advocates, patients, and their loved ones.
Battling disease, particularly one
that is determined rare, is a significant challenge.
But through advocacy and
other means, patients are banding together to join forces.
Delivering
#CuresNow will bring hope to everyone battling disease, no matter how rare.

 'Two in A Million': TLC show pairs people with rare medical conditions



 "You're one in a million" is the cliched compliment of pop songs and
Valentine's Day cards.
But if you live with one of the rarest medical conditions
in the world, is there anything you wouldn't do to know you're not so unique --
that there's someone else out there just like you?
McIver had made an award-winning
student film about Owen Howkins, a British boy with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome who
is featured in the first episode, and his dog, Haatchi.
We wondered, what if Owen had ever met anyone else with the same condition --
and what it would be like if he did."
Each of the six episodes features a different genetic disease: Schwartz-Jampel
syndrome, ectodermal dysplasia, lamellar ichthyosis, osteogenesis imperfecta,
Jarcho-Levin syndrome and Goldenhar syndrome.

Tour highlights plight of rare disease diagnosis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.
It took Angela Massel years to be diagnosed with congenital central
hypoventilation syndrome.
Doctors thought Erika Crawford's Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome was all in her head.
About 20 people suffering from a range of rare diseases, which affects about one
in 12 Canadians, attended a roundtable event hosted by Kitchener-Conestoga MPP
Michael Harris last week.
The event was part of his cross-province tour, where he heard from many
Ontarians about what the government can do to better take care of people
suffering from rare diseases.
Her friend, Johann Kerlow, suffers from atypical hemolytic-uremic
syndrome, a disease that causes blood clots to form in small blood vessels in
the kidneys.
"Rare is rare.
Harris will introduce a private member's motion to be debated on March 3, asking
for an all-party committee to travel across

Ontario to listen to experts and sufferers of rare diseases.
The goal of the select committee will be to come up with recommendations to
improve the

treatment of patients with rare diseases.
"People say
we can't afford it, but I'm a conservative, and I

know there are gaps in the system and it's failing people that have a rare
disease."

My boy will get all the care he needs, under a single roof;
It's the good news that people with rare diseases have been waiting for: the
opening of a centre bringing together the right specialists in one place.
But he also has one of the world's rarest
diseases: Alström syndrome, a genetic disorder that can eventually damage almost
every organ in the body.
As an adult he faces blindness
and diabetes, a risk of heart, kidney and liver disease and an ever-present
tendency to obesity.
Suffering from a rare disease brings a double set of disadvantages.
First, there
is little hope of a cure for disorders that are too rare to justify investment
in research by the pharmaceutical industry; second, doctors are largely ignorant
about a syndrome that affects so few people.
"I had to become an expert in Kion's health as I discovered that doctors don't
necessarily know best when treating someone with a rare disease," she recalls.
These professionals were often
based in different hospitals, and none knew much about Alström syndrome.
Today sees the formal opening
of Britain's first Rare Diseases Centre, at the University of Birmingham.
Funded
mainly by the Department of Health, to the tune of nearly £31 million, the
centre will provide not only joined-up health care for patients with a rare
disease, but state-of-the-art research facilities.
Scientists have so far identified some 6,000 rare diseases, in total affecting
one in 17 of Britain's population.
The growth in the understanding of genetic
disorders, which began with the human genome sequence, has made scientists
confident that breakthroughs in treatment, whether with drugs or stem cells or
gene therapy, are not far off.
"There's now talk of finding treatments
for 200 rare diseases over the next decade or so and the centre will lead this
research."
A major contribution to early research has come from the use of the zebra fish,
which is already being studied by heart disease researchers investigating its
ability to regenerate its own cardiac muscle.
"These amazing fish are a cheap and very efficient way of testing the impact and
safety of drugs for rare genetic conditions," says Dr Ferenc Müller, reader in
genetics at Birmingham University.
"That's because the genetic defects responsible for rare diseases also provide
clues to the causes of some cancers," says Prof Maher.
"So studying rare
diseases could contribute to cancer treatments."
At the heart of the new service is a "Rolls-Royce" personalised health care
service, according to Professor Tim Barrett, a consultant paediatrician and
Alström syndrome expert.

 Remember Max?
Max has a RASopathy called Noonan syndrome, which prevents normal development
in various parts of the body.
In Max's blog post, he explains the disease and
his strong support for the 21st Century Cures Act.
"21st Century Cures is legislation to help all those that are sick, not just
those with rare diseases," explains Max.
But I guess it started sooner
than that, on the day I was born with a rare disease - a RASopathy called Noonan
Syndrome.
Noonan Syndrome is a genetic syndrome that affects cell growth and
cell development.
Rare is not as rare as you think.
There are over 7,000 rare diseases in the
world.
95% of them don't have treatments.
21st Century Cures is legislation to help all those that are sick, not just
those with rare diseases.
We need to smack down and
take down the horrible diseases.
We all deserve treatments and cures.
Please help develop new
treatments and cures!

ELYSHIA Hickey has a rare and painful disease, but that's not stopping her from
sharing her story in front of a crowd at a national conference in Melbourne this
month.
The Cairns nursing student suffers from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a rare
genetic condition that has left her with overly flexible joints, stretchy skin,
and prone to dislocations.
The condition is caused by a defect in how the body
makes collagen in its connective tissues.
Both Elyshia, 19, and her younger sister Emily, 15, suffer from the syndrome,
which leaves them frequently in pain, and Elyshia occasionally wheelchair bound.
Elyshia, however, will be heading to the National Rare Disease Summit in
Melbourne on March 27-28 to advocate on behalf of those who live with the
condition, and help gather support to lobby the Federal Government for a
national plan.
She believes rare disease patients deserve the same level of care, empathy and
knowledgeable treatment as a person with cancer or heart disease, no matter
where they live.
"If you have a rare disease that is invisible - you look fine on the outside -
it is almost impossible to get a correct diagnosis in a timely manner," she
said.
"Early diagnosis means early intervention and effective treatment to help
young people reach their potential.
"But very few doctors and specialists have the knowledge and expertise to
diagnose rare invisible conditions."
She said some patients may visit more than
20 doctors before getting a correct diagnosis.
"There is limited training available for specialists and no national rare
disease clinical advice network that doctors can refer to for up-to-date
information," she said.
"We need a registry in Australia of doctors who have experience with rare
diseases.
"We need more research into rare diseases; the flow-on being a better
understanding of how the body works.
"A national plan for rare diseases will alleviate these problems, but we are the
last developed nation not to have a national plan for rare disease.
"Also, chronic pain can be severely debilitating and costs the medical system
more than diabetes and heart conditions put together," she said.
"A new
Persistent Pain Clinic was established at the Cairns Hospital in 2014, but many
patients are still unaware the service is available.

Giant takes up fight against rare diseases

Britain's biggest drugs company has created a division to deal specifically with
rare diseases, such as Huntington's, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and
hard-to-treat cancers.
Many have ignored diseases that affect hundreds or
thousands of patients a year, as they can be difficult to treat and

have a limited number of patients to sell drugs to, in favour of easier sales
of, for instance, anti-depressant drugs, More recently, orphan drug legislation
and approaching patent expiries on other, more widely used drugs, has forced
pharmaceutical groups to reconsider rare diseases.
Medicines to treat rare
diseases may also be relatively expensive, as often there is no alternative
treatment.
The new unit will start by targeting about 200 of the world's
estimated 6,000-8,000 rare diseases.
The move comes as the Francebased

Sanofi-Aventis is bidding $18.5 billion (£11.6 billion) for Genzyme, the world's
most successful developer of rare disease drugs, which charges more than
$200,000 a year for Cerezyme, its Gaucher disease treatment.
Marc Dunoyer, global head of GSK Rare Diseases, said: "There is a very
tight-knit community within rare diseases; there are small numbers of patients
affected by these diseases and they are very often experts on their condition.
Treatment of patients with rare diseases is often undertaken by very specialised
physicians, who are also the clinical investigators seeking new treatments for
these conditions.
"We believe the most effective way to become integrated into this community is
to ensure that we have dedicated employees within GSK who can work with
patients, physicians and academia to continuously extend our understanding."
GSK has also signed an agreement with Italian gene therapy experts researching
stem-cell treatments for rare childhood immune diseases including severe
combined immune deficiency syndrome, also known as "bubble boy" disorder.
Fondazione Telethon and Fondazione San Raffaele will receive an upfront (EURO)10
million (£8.8 million) payment from GSK, with more available if its treatments
are successful.

April 28--WILLIAMS BAY -- Courtney Waller and Reece Mills felt so alone when
they found out their infant daughter had a rare disease.
Courtney knew there must be other families affected by Timothy Syndrome, an
ultra-rare genetic disorder.
Fewer than 40 people with the condition have been
reported worldwide.
Courtney used the power of social media to find five other moms, who have
children with the syndrome, in the United States and United Kingdom.
Through her
Facebook group, she also contacted two mothers who lost children to the
condition and the woman who discovered it.
"This is a powerful message to send to other families who have children with
rare diseases," Courtney of Williams Bay said.
"No matter how alone you feel,
you may still be able to find those who understand your circumstances and can
point you ... to the best treatments available."
She added: "As anyone in the medical and rare disease community will attest, it
is not uncommon for the parents of these children to know more about the
syndromes than their doctors."
Born in October, Theodora is in stable condition and goes to a Milwaukee
hospital once a month for evaluation.
The main characteristic of Timothy Syndrome is a heart condition known as Long
QT, which causes the heart muscle to take longer to recharge between beats.
"This is the leading cause of death for Timothy Syndrome children," Courtney
said.
In addition to the heart, the condition also affects the brain and the pancreas.
Through a Facebook group, Courtney and Reece have connected with a parent whose
child with the syndrome is 22.
"It was
such a relief to find other people thriving with this condition."
Because of the research, Theodora was diagnosed with a specific form of Long QT
within moments of birth and received treatments tailored to her specific form.
"Dr. (Janette) Strasburger and
the research she is conducting in Madison is a promising step towards detecting
some of these fatal conditions.

ON Sunday, the Cairns community is being invited to show their support for
people affected by a rare disease.
It will be the fourth time that Cairns will host an event at the Cairns
Esplanade to recognise International Rare Disease Day.
One woman who has first-hand knowledge of the difficulties facing people with a
rare disease is Meagan Cross, who four years ago with her husband Rohan
established the Cairns Rare Disease Day event.
It came after their youngest daughter Molly - who is now four years old - was
diagnosed with the extremely rare Angelman syndrome, a neurological genetic
disorder which causes speech impediment, balance and movement disorders, sleep
disturbances and seizures.
"We came across the International Rare Disease Day and then we looked at
Australian events and representations and there wasn't anything," Meagan said.
"Although we raise money, primarily it is raising awareness and giving the
families who are affected by a rare disease, some sense of belonging in the
community and helping people understand what they go through."
It is thought that about one in 20,000 people have Angelman syndrome, named
after English paediatrician Dr Harry Angelman.
International Rare Disease Day is an annual awareness-raising event that aims to
draw attention to rare diseases and the millions of people who are affected by
8000 known rare diseases.
"Rare Disease Day is about bringing people together to share things that they
have done and to get some strength from each other," Meagan said.
Proceeds from Cairns Rare Disease Day will go to the Edward Koch Foundation and
be used to support FNQ families affected by rare conditions.
Cairns Rare Disease Day will be held this Sunday at the Fun Ship Playground,
northern end of the Cairns Esplanade, from 8.30am.

Funding needed for Aspergers group

THE Wessex Autistic Society is appealing for help towards the annual cost of
providing free drop-in groups to adults with Asperger's Syndrome in Dorchester
Yeovil and Bournemouth.
Having offered a successful drop-in group to adults with high functioning
autism/Asperger's Syndrome in Bournemouth for the last 10 years, the Society
recently introduced a drop-in group to Dorchester and have plans in place to
launch a new group in Yeovil.
Attending meetings enables patients to meet with other women who have a similar
diagnosis and may have had similar treatments.
Rare Disease   Day next week

THE fourth Rare Disease Day takes place on Monday and the message to local
people is there is no need to feel socially isolated after being diagnosed with
a rare condition.
The national event is managed by EURODIS and National Alliances of Patient
Organisations, and this year's slogan is Rare But Equal.
There are various rare diseases and many are disabling, leaving the lives of
sufferers compromised.
Most rare diseases are chronic with no known cure, and if
left untreated many can be fatal.
The Myasthenia Gravis Association is supporting Rare Disease Day.
Jane Goodchild from Wincanton is an MG sufferer: "I will not pretend that life
has been easy, I lost part of my childhood to MG."

Like most rare diseases, diagnosis is often difficult and can take many years to
be identified.
Rare Disease Day aims to increase public consciousness of all rare diseases.

In Europe, Revestive is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
short bowel syndrome who should be stable following a period of intestinal
adaptation after surgery.
With our global strength and
expertise in both rare diseases and GI, Shire is uniquely positioned to drive
the continued success of GATTEX/REVESTIVE, and, if approved, commercialize NPS
Pharma's pipeline compound NATPARA/NATPAR.
The NPS Pharma organization will be a welcome addition to Shire as we
continue to help transform the lives of patients with rare diseases."
Francois Nader, MD, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NPS
Pharma, stated:

"Shire shares NPS Pharma's commitment to patients with rare diseases.
We believe
that joining our two companies will drive value for shareholders and ensure we
continue to transform the lives of patients with short bowel syndrome,
hypoparathyroidism, and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia worldwide.

confident that this transaction will accelerate our ambition of creating a world
where every person living with a rare disease has a therapy.
I would like to
thank all of our employees for their continued outstanding contributions and
steadfast commitment to the patients we serve."
Information on NPS Pharma

NPS Pharma is a commercial-stage rare disease-focused biopharmaceutical company,
whose first product, GATTEX (teduglutide [rDNA origin]) for injection, has been
launched in the U.S. to treat adults with short bowel syndrome (SBS).
NPS Pharma's second product rhPTH [1-84] (NATPARA in the U.S. /
NATPAR in Europe) is currently under review in the U.S. and Europe for the
treatment for hypoparathyroidism (HPT).
NPS Pharma has an ongoing Phase 2a study
evaluating its lead pipeline candidate NPSP795 for the treatment of adults with
autosomal dominant hypocalcemia.
Information on GATTEX/REVESTIVE

In the United States, GATTEX (teduglutide [rDNA origin]) for injection is
approved  for the long-term treatment of adults with short bowel syndrome (SBS)
who need parenteral support.
GATTEX is the first analog of GLP-2 approved to
treat SBS, a disease which may require patients to get their nutrition
intravenously through a central line.
SBS is a condition in which a large portion of the intestine has been removed by
surgery.
It can also be caused by disease or injury
that prevents the small intestine from functioning properly despite normal
length.
In the U.S., approximately 6,000-7,000 SBS patients are dependent on parenteral
support with a similar prevalence in Europe.
Information on NATPARA/NATPAR

NATPARA/NATPAR, NPS Pharma's parathyroid hormone (rhPTH [1-84]) for the
treatment of hypoparathyroidism (HPT), a rare endocrine disorder characterized
by insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), is currently under review
in the U.S. with an FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for
the Biologics License Application (BLA) on January 24, 2015.
HPT is a rare condition in which the parathyroid glands fail to produce
sufficient amounts of PTH or where PTH lacks biologic activity.
In
patients with HPT, insufficient levels of PTH lead to many physiological
abnormalities, including low serum calcium and an inability to convert native
vitamin D into its active state to properly absorb dietary calcium.
In the U.S., approximately 75,000 patients are diagnosed with HPT with 41,000
having moderate to severe disease with a similar prevalence in EU5 (France,
Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and Spain).
NPS Pharma is developing teduglutide as a treatment for pediatric SBS.
NPS
Pharma is currently conducting a global study for teduglutide in pediatric
patients with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support.
NPSP795 is in development as a treatment for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia
(ADH).
There is no approved therapy for this ultra-rare, life-long genetic
disorder that affects both adults and children.
The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the
tender of a majority of the outstanding NPS Pharma shares and the receipt of
Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance.
Pending such closing conditions, it is anticipated
that the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2015.

NPS Pharmaceuticals Recognized by National Organization for Rare Disorders for
Gattex as an Innovative Treatment for Patients with Short Bowel Syndrome

LENGTH: 663  words


New Delhi, May 18 -- NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: NPSP), a
biopharmaceutical company pioneering and delivering therapies that transform the
lives of patients with rare diseases worldwide, today announced that the company
was honored by the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) for the FDA
approval of Gattex (teduglutide [rDNA origin]) for injection, which is indicated
for the treatment of adult patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) who are
dependent on parenteral support.
SBS is a rare and potentially fatal
gastrointestinal disorder in which patients are unable to absorb enough
nutrients and fluids through the intestine from the foods they eat.
"We are honored to be recognized by NORD and proud to have contributed to making
a significant difference in the lives of patients with Short Bowel Syndrome"
said Francois Nader, M.D., president and chief executive officer of NPS
Pharmaceuticals.
"The mission of NORD and dedication of their leadership has
proven to be an essential catalyst in improving the lives of patients with rare
diseases over the past three decades."
The event commemorated the 30th anniversary of the enactment of the Orphan Drug
Act and the formation of NORD, while honoring companies and individuals who made
significant contributions to the rare disease community in 2012.
NPS was honored
for bringing Gattex, the first major advance for the long-term treatment of SBS
in nearly 40 years, to adult patients with the rare disorder who are dependent
on parenteral support.
"We at NORD would like to congratulate NPS for its innovative and important work
on behalf of short bowel syndrome patients in the U.S. and for making a
particularly significant contribution by bringing a new treatment option to
these patients," said Peter L. Saltonstall, president and chief executive
officer of NORD.
The event was held at the Mellon Auditorium in Washington, DC on Tuesday, May
14, 2013 to honor leadership in public policy and pioneers in the patient
community, government and industry for years of service to rare disease patients
and their families.
About Short Bowel Syndrome

Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a highly disabling condition that can impair a
patient's quality of life and lead to serious life-threatening complications.
SBS typically arises after extensive resection of the bowel due to Crohn's
disease, ischemia or other conditions.
SBS patients often suffer from
malnutrition, severe diarrhea, dehydration, fatigue, osteopenia, and weight loss
due to the reduced intestinal capacity to absorb nutrients, water and
electrolytes.
The usual treatment for SBS is nutritional support, including
parenteral nutrition (PN) and/or intravenous (IV) fluids to supplement and
stabilize nutritional needs.
Although PN can provide nutritional support for SBS patients, it does not
improve the body's own ability to absorb nutrients.
PN is associated with
serious complications, such as infections, blood clots or liver damage, and the
risks increase the longer patients are on PN.
Patients on PN often experience
poor quality of life with difficulty sleeping, and frequent urination, and
patients receiving chronic PN often experience a loss of independence.

NIH Scientists Pursue New Therapies to Improve rare Disease drug Development

LENGTH: 786  words


New Delhi, Sept. 12 -- Four new pre-clinical drug development projects at the
National Institutes of Health will target a form of blindness and diseases
characterized by cardiac problems.
The projects were selected for their
potential to treat specific rare diseases and to help scientists uncover new
information that can be shared with other researchers.
The studies will be funded through the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected
Diseases (TRND) program at the NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational
Sciences (NCATS).
This group of projects also marks the TRND program's first use
of stem cells as well as its first collaboration with a large pharmaceutical
company, Eli Lilly, to co-develop a treatment for a rare disease.
Two projects employ therapeutic approaches to developing a treatment for
retinitis pigmentosa, a severe form of hereditary blindness.
A third project
focuses on a potential treatment for hypoparathyroidism, a hormone-deficiency
syndrome that can lead to cardiac problems and convulsions.
The remaining project aims to develop a possible therapeutic that targets a
cardiac disorder associated with LEOPARD syndrome, an extremely rare genetic
disease that affects many areas of the body.
About 80 percent of patients with
LEOPARD syndrome have a cardiac disorder called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder
to pump blood, which can lead to early death.
A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 Americans.
NIH estimates
that, in total, there are more than 6,000 rare diseases.
However, effective
pharmacologic treatments exist for only about 200 of these illnesses.
Private companies often do not pursue new therapies for rare diseases due to the
low anticipated return on investment.
Through TRND, NCATS advances potential
treatments for rare and neglected tropical diseases to first-in-human trials, an
approach known as "de-risking."
The new projects are:

Long-acting parathyroid hormone analog for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism

Henry U. Bryant, Ph.D., distinguished research fellow

Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis

Use of rapamycin for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in patients

Small molecule pharmacological chaperone for the treatment of retinitis
pigmentosa

William F. Brubaker, Ph.D., chief executive officer

Bikam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.
The collaborative project teams receive
in-kind support and gain access to TRND researchers with rare disease drug
development capabilities, expertise, and clinical and regulatory resources.
"We are particularly excited about this set of collaborative projects for its
potential to produce treatments for underserved patient populations," said John
C. McKew, Ph.D., acting director of NCATS Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation
and director of the TRND program.
A number of early projects fostered by TRND have reached the stage where
partners, such as pharmaceutical, biotechnology or disease groups, are being
sought to move the treatments out of TRND and in the next phases of clinical
development.
Through the program in the last two years, TRND researchers and
collaborators have advanced four projects to human clinical trials, evaluating
treatments for sickle cell disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hereditary
inclusion body myopathy and Niemann-Pick Type C.

Number of rare diseases in Kuwait high

LENGTH: 2532 words


COMMON bone conditions such as osteoporosis are well identified and treated,
though rare bone diseases still continue to remain rare.
There has been a sudden
increase in rare diseases in the Middle East as well.
In this interview, Philip
Beales, Professor of Medical Genetics, explains the genetic causes of rare
diseases and how the UCL Institute of Child Health (ICH) has shed light on a key
enzyme involved in the development and maintenance of bone which could help find
future therapies to treat rare and common diseases.
LMS (Lenz-Majewski Syndrome
) which has been identified by the international study as the mutated gene in
people is a skeletal disorder which causes bone malformations and also affects
the brain.
So far, only ten cases of this syndrome have been identified.
Question: What is a rare bone disease?
Answer: It's literally numbers in the sense that the condition is present in the
population in less than one or fewer than one in 2000 persons.
In such cases, it
is considered rare.
Of course, it is not a very helpful term but it is helpful
when you consider that there are around 6000 described rare entities or rare
diseases in their own right.
So you will find that some of these are clearly
incredibly rare, one in a million.
The fact that having this disease isn't very common, most health
services aren't geared up to dealing with people who have this unusual
condition, they are more geared up to dealing with blood pressure, diabetes and
obesity.
One of the problems you will always hear from patients is this
diagnostic odyssey is that patients go many years without a diagnosis and that
has been the case for a long time.
But the changes in the genetic technology has
now enabled us to rapidly get to a diagnosis that previously had been left and
the care for patients with rare diseases is usually suboptimal for the same
reasons that the health services are not geared up to looking after them.
But to
take care of these patients is a multi team approach.
Q: What are the genetic causes of rare bone disease?
A: As I said, on the web
and various databases there are now about six to seven thousand listed rare
genetic disorders described in detail.
There's
still at least two- thirds of these to be sorted out, but there are a number of
international and national programs that are going on where the majority of
these conditions will be solved.
But the benefit of
finding the genetic cause of a particular condition, particularly a rare one or
even common one is that it's multi-folded because the first thing is you
instantly have a diagnostic test, so not only does it confirm the disease in
that patient it also enables a carrier test to be developed for other members of
the family who might be at risk, brothers or sisters.
And then the final
component obviously of understanding the genetic cause of any condition is that
it can tell you how that disease arises and what are the developmental processes
that cause the disease, which is a prerequisite for thinking about therapies and
so now we are getting nearer to many of these conditions and we are able to
think about instant therapies or develop therapies like gene therapy.
Q: Is the number of rare disease in Kuwait very high?
A: Yes, it is very high
because of the simple fact that the cultural norm is to marry within the family
and so it's not a character problem in any way, it's simply that you are
increasing the statistical probability that you are going to keep, if its what's
called a recessive disease.
Q: How do rare diseases develop?
A: Depends on the disease; you can have a disease
that's affecting just one part of the body, like the eye in the form of
blindness.
Some of the conditions I work on have blindness but affects virtually
every part of the body, so they would have obesity, diabetes that's actually one
of the most common conditions in the rare disease.
A condition called
Bardet-Biedl syndrome has been documented on being more common rare disease in
this country, and the most common rare disease in Europe is Cystic fibrosis but
for the Bardet - Biedl syndrome may be 1 in 50 people or more in this country
are carrying it so it's one of the most common one in Kuwait and so that affects
every part of the body.
About 5 to 10
percent of the children affected by this disease will not make it to their 5th
birthdays.
A: Again it depends on which
condition it is because if the gene isn't really active in the brain it won't
have any effect; but again this condition I am talking about Bardet-Biedl
syndrome does affect the brain in many ways.
First of all, the patients have
learning difficulties, they can be mild or severe and the other aspect is that
there can be parts of the brain that haven't formed properly.
Moreover, by doing MRI
scans on the brains of several patients suffering from Bardet - Biedl syndrome
has revealed more things.
We found that we can manipulate this part of the brain and correct
certain defects, which will improve the condition of patients who will have less
learning difficulties later in life so that they can look after themselves.
Most
of our patients need support later in life, so in other words they are going to
be unemployed; they are not going to be able to live by themselves most of the
time, but if we can intervene in children then more of them can get to adulthood
and become active members of the society and work.
Q: How rare is the rare bone disease?
A: 1 in 17 people in Europe have this
disease.
A: This is the condition called Lenz-Majweski Syndrome, where
the patients have intellectual disabilities but they have a bunch of other
problems that include an usual phase and major bone problems.
These patients are dwarfs and have short limbs, have all sorts of bone
problems and very thick bones, but this is incredibly rare and there are only a
handful of patients in the world.
It has an affect on the development of the
brain' but it also has an effect on the development of the cells that go to make
up the skeleton and the important part is that this gives us potential insight
into the understanding of causes or treatments perhaps of osteoporosis which is
much more common.
But it links for the first time this group of proteins to bones so
there could be an opportunity to look at treatment.
Q: Osteoporosis is a more common condition, how has this new discovery at UCL
helped with it?
We will be able to find treatments for conditions such as
osteoporosis or other bony conditions.
Q: Is Bardet-Biedl syndrome inherited from parents?
A:
The first challenge was actually finding the gene and that now is driven by our
relatively new center that has been running for 3 years, called the Center of
Translational Genomics and our job is to find undiscovered genes in problem
patients and rare conditions.
The next
job was to do some experiments and find the right team which is why I got in
touch with the team from the University of Alberta in Canada and so we had to
get their expertise to determine what happens if you knock down this particular
protein in a cell, so we took patients cells and were able to show that this
protein is not functioning properly in those cells and in my own lab we showed
that this protein is actually working and for that we used zebra fish because
they have the same gene.
A: It is the first insight into
bony development so this could lead to a whole new area of research around this
one protein but we might be able to unearth new treatments to turn this gene on,
or turn this gene off.
Q: Why is this rare disease so undiagnosed and misdiagnosed?
A: One because it
is incredibly rare, this is the problem with rare diseases there are no experts
so a lot of patients keep going from one center to another till they find
someone who is interested in their condition and knows something about the
condition.
Q: Do you think that rare diseases are under-researched?
A: Absolutely, yes they
haven't been funded for many years because billions of dollars went into
understanding the genetics of common diseases so the rare diseases were
completely ignored but now the tables have changed.
Now spending millions of
dollars on common diseases has not really got so far and now everyone is turning
towards rare diseases.
Q: Is it true that too much tea can cause rare diseases?
biography Q: What message would you like to give the readers regarding bone
diseases?
A: Well as its known, the most common one is the thinning of the bones
and although there are some treatment around at the moment there is room for
better treatment or better ways to avoid osteoporosis so these types of studies,
maybe 10 years from now, might tell us that when you are in your 40s or maybe
even earlier in your 30s you should start modifying your life in a particular
way to avoid bone disease later on but what is known is that maintaining
exercise, health and dairy products will help with maintaining healthy bones and
teeth and Vitamin D as well.
In the northern hemisphere, in the colder climates
diseases like Rickets are fairly common until they fortified milk with Vitamin D
but also the other thing is that Vitamin D which obviously maintains healthy
bones is good to certain level as it can also cause cancer.

Representatives  has issued the following press release:



 Battling disease is tough enough, but one rare disease patient advocate
recently chronicled a harsh and difficult reality facing a number of patients -
abandonment by loved ones after diagnosis.
Angela Davis writes about her

According to the National Organization for Rare Diseases, Stiff-person
syndrome "is a rare acquired neurological disorder characterized by progressive
muscle stiffness (rigidity) and repeated muscle spasms."
It is a disease that
affects one in a million.
But like most rare disease patients, Angela is a fighter, she persevered, and
now sees hope in the effort to deliver #CuresNow.
She writes, "If you know any
rare disease patient and want to help, insist your state senators,

Rare disease patients pave the way for advancements in medicine for every
person, which can help you and your family's well-being too."
Angela closes with an important message, "Lastly, please offer anyone close to
you with a rare disease your support, practical help, and your cherished
kindness."

Information on NPS Pharma

NPS Pharma is a commercial-stage rare disease-focused biopharmaceutical company,
whose first product, GATTEX (teduglutide [rDNA origin]) for injection, has been
launched in the U.S. to treat adults with short bowel syndrome (SBS).
NPS Pharma's second product rhPTH -83 (NATPARA in the U.S. / NATPAR
in Europe) is currently under review in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment
for hypoparathyroidism (HPT).
NPS Pharma has an ongoing Phase 2a study
evaluating its lead pipeline candidate NPSP795 for the treatment of adults with
autosomal dominant hypocalcemia.
Information on GATTEX/REVESTIVE

In the United States, GATTEX (teduglutide [rDNA origin]) for injection is
approved  for the long-term treatment of adults with short bowel syndrome (SBS)
who need parenteral support.
GATTEX is the first analog of GLP-2 approved to
treat SBS, a disease which may require patients to get their nutrition
intravenously through a central line.
SBS is a condition in which a large portion of the intestine has been removed by
surgery.
It can also be caused by disease or injury
that prevents the small intestine from functioning properly despite normal
length.
In the U.S., approximately 6,000-7,000 SBS patients are dependent on parenteral
support with a similar prevalence in Europe.2

GATTEX has received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and was approved in December 2012.
Information on NATPARA/NATPAR

NATPARA/NATPAR, NPS Pharma's parathyroid hormone (rhPTH -83) for the treatment
of hypoparathyroidism (HPT), a rare endocrine disorder characterized by
insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), is currently under review in
the U.S. with an FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for the
Biologics License Application (BLA) on January 24, 2015.
HPT is a rare condition in which the parathyroid glands fail to produce
sufficient amounts of PTH or where PTH lacks biologic activity.
In
patients with HPT, insufficient levels of PTH lead to many physiological
abnormalities, including low serum calcium and an inability to convert native
vitamin D into its active state to properly absorb dietary calcium.
In the U.S., approximately 75,000 patients are diagnosed with HPT with 41,000
having moderate to severe disease with a similar prevalence in EU5 (France,
Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and Spain).3

Acute symptoms of HPT are largely due to low serum calcium and range from muscle
pain and tingling, to lack of focus or ability to concentrate, and anxiety and
depression.
NPS Pharma is developing teduglutide as a treatment for pediatric SBS.
NPS
Pharma is currently conducting a global study for teduglutide in pediatric
patients with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support.
NPSP795
is in development as a treatment for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH).
There is no approved therapy for this ultra-rare, life-long genetic disorder
that affects both adults and children.
The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the
tender of a majority of the outstanding NPS Pharma shares and the receipt of
Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance.
Pending such closing conditions, it is anticipated
that the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2015.

Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals: Nurse Wins Supercar in Raffle for Rare
Disease Group

LENGTH: 292  words


New Delhi, July 29 -- A nurse from City Hospital has won the chance to live like
a celebrity for the day and drive a luxury sports car - and raised money for a
worthwhile cause in the process.
The local Behcet's Syndrome Society group, which supports people from across the
Midlands who have this rare disease, raffled tickets to raise funds, with the
star prize being 24 hours with a 100,000 Audi R8 convertible.
The group meets
monthly at the Birmingham Behcet's Syndrome Centre of Excellence, which is based
at City Hospital, part of Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust.
Debbie Mitton, who is lead nurse and manager of the Behcet's Syndrome Centre of
Excellence, was the surprise winner of the raffle, which was being held to
coincide with a 'Behcet's in a Day' education event at City Hospital.
The study day was attended by doctors, nurses and other health professionals
from across the country, and aimed to tell them more about the symptoms and
treatment of this disease, which affects just 500 or so people in the UK.
Debbie, who is from Wombourne, said: "Behcet's syndrome is a rare condition that
causes inflammation of the blood vessels, with symptoms including mouth and
genital ulcers, eye inflammation and skin lesions, and can lead to arthritis,
bowel inflammation and meningitis.
"Having worked at the centre since November 2012, I have seen at first-hand how
the local group does so much for people in the area with this rare disease,
offering support, sharing advice and treatments and even running a helpline.

Lack of UAE data in focus on Rare Disease Day

LENGTH: 515 words


Dubai: In a show of solidarity with more than 250 UAE children with rare
diseases and their families on the occasion of Rare Disease Day, the Shaikh
Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award for Medical Sciences held an open day on
Thursday at Children's City, Creek Park, Dubai.
On and around February 28, hundreds of organisations from more than 60 countries
and regions worldwide hold awareness programmes highlighting the slogan 'Rare
Disorders without Borders'.
According to the organisers of the open day, there are between 6,000 to 8,000
rare diseases that have been documented.
Patients suffering from these diseases
often face difficulties such as delayed or wrongful diagnosis, psychological
consequences and inadequate scientific support.
In the UAE, the incidence of rare diseases cannot be ascertained for want of a
central registry.
Dr Fatima Bastaki, consultant paediatrician in clinical genetics and metabolism
at Latifa Hospital and head of the campaign's organising committee, said that
the Centre for Arab Genomic Studies, a division of the Award for Medical
Sciences, has catalogued 350 rare genetic disorders in Arab populations.
"Due to a lack of nationwide statistical information and given the number of
patients with rare diseases, the number will definitely be higher," she said.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) states that rare diseases range from cystic
fibrosis and haemophilia to Angelman Syndrome, with an incidence of about 1 in
15,000, to Opitz trigonocephaly syndrome, which is extremely rare with about one
case per million people.
Eight out of 10 cases of rare diseases have genetic origins and five to 7 out of
10 cases affect children, Dr Fatima said.
Patients with rare diseases and their families feel isolated and vulnerable,
said Dr Fatima Al Jasmi, Assistant Professor in biochemical genetics at the
United Arab University (UAEU).
"We need to change the societal attitude towards
people with rare diseases and look at inclusion at all levels, from education to
labour market."

 Health Reporter
 KELLY du Plessis, founder of the Rare Diseases Society of South Africa, said
Rett syndrome affects one in 12000 girls and is rarely seen in boys.
Because there is no registry for rare diseases, Du Plessis said it was
difficult to tell how many South Africans suffered from it.
Du Plessis explained there were four stages for the condition:
 lThe first is the slowed development stage, which affects girls at six to 18
months.
The cause of Rett Syndrome is unclear, but it has been found that most children
with the condition have a mutation in a particular gene on the X chromosome.
Boys who develop Rett Syndrome usually die shortly after birth because they
only have one X chromosome.
She encouraged parents and families with loved ones who have rare diseases to
visit http://www.rarediseases.co.za and sign up - it is a free membership, which
may assist in formulating a rare disease registry for South Africa.

Washington: Grandparents Rally to Help Deliver #CuresNow to Toddler in the
\x93Fight for His Life"

LENGTH: 710  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington, DC: Energy & Commerce Committee United States House of
Representatives  has issued the following press release:



 Two-year-old Spencer Robert Smith was recently diagnosed with MPS-III,
Sanfilippo syndrome.
The rare, genetic disease has launched his grandparents
into action to find a cure for their sweet and always smiling grandson.
The disease, which affects the brain and spinal cord, has no known cure and is
progressive.
Children with the disease experience deafness, blindness,
paralysis, and seizures.
Spencer's grandmother, Linda Hinman, described it as
Alzheimer's disease for children.
Naturally, Spencer's family has been trying to
do anything and everything to reverse the disease's course.
When the doctor delivered the news of Spencer's rare disease, Linda says, "she
told us there are no cures for rare diseases like Spencer's because there is not
enough funding for research."
Since then, they have been encouraging friends and family to help
spread the word about legislation that would bring hope for helping kids like
Spencer find cures and treatments.
"The 21st Century Cures Act could help save children's lives, because it would
provide funds to the National Institute of Health and the Food and Drug
Administration to help find cures for these rare diseases," Linda
explained.Spencer Robert Smith was a happy baby, growing and developing into a
healthy toddler except for some seemingly minor issues like frequent congestion,
balance problems, enlarged adenoids and fluid in his ears.
But a few weeks ago, his family received the devastating news that he was
diagnosed with MPS-III, Sanfilippo Syndrome, "a rare, incurable, insidious,
progressive, and fatal disease," grandparents Linda and Kirk Hinman explained.
Spencer "faces a progressive and fatal decline: deafness, blindness, seizures,
paralysis, organ shutdown and death," the couple said, as the disease attacks
his muscular and neurological systems.
According to a Sanfilippo Syndrome support website, the lifespan of an affected
child does not usually extend beyond late teens to early twenties.
The Hinmans -- including parents Nate and Alli (Hinman) Smith -- are hoping to
help change the course of the disease, not just for Spencer, but for all
children and families impacted by Sanfilippo Syndrome and other rare diseases by
raising awareness of these conditions, Linda said, and also by convincing New
York State's two senators in Washington, D.C., to vote for the 21st Century
Cures Act.
This legislation, the Hinman's say, can help fund research into Sanfilippo
Syndrome and other rare incurable diseases that affect children like their
two-year-old grandson.
The bill, the
Hinmans said, would "provide funds to the National Institute of Health and the
Food and Drug Administration to help find cures for these rare diseases."
These issues will be followed by
additional degenerative conditions that will slowly rob Spencer of his ability
to communicate, move about and develop like other children.
The couple likened the disease to Alzheimer's for children.

JAIPUR: Lysosomal Storage Disorders Support Society (LSDSS) has appealed to
chief minister Vasudhara Raje to show urgency for the treatment of patients with
this rare disease.
Five children with the disease have already died in the
recent past.
LSDSS has submitted a letter of appeal with patients' medical
certificates and other relevant documents to government officials including
health minister Rajendra Rathore urging them to take a step for providing
treatment to children suffering from lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs).
Majority of children with LSD are unable to get treatment as its yearly cost is
estimated to be Rs 1 crore.
A patient requires treatment throughout life.
"My son
is suffering from Hunter syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II).
When he
was just four-years-old, he was diagnosed with the disease.
Since the treatment is quite expensive, which is almost Rs 1 crore per year, I
am unable to start his treatment.
He is surviving without treatment," the boy's
father said.
Since the cost of treatment is quite
high, the father is unable to provide the required treatment for his son.
The
LSDSS has pointed out that the families of the rare patients are going through a
tough time for the past three years (5 children have died already), as they
cannot afford the life-saving treatment for their children due to its high cost.
The families are hopeful that the government will take necessary steps
immediately to provide access to life-saving treatment.
"Fourteen months ago, at
the round table, health minister Rajendra Singh Rathore had announced to set up
a committee for LSD patients.
He had also said that a nodal officer would be
deputed to undertake a number of welfare initiatives including making treatment
available under National Health Mission and drugs available under the free
medicine scheme for the patients.
It has been 14 months now and these patients
are still waiting to hear from the government on implementing the initiatives,"
LSDSS mentioned in the letter to the CM.On February 25, families of rare disease
patients had met key genetic experts and health ministry officials to discuss
their plight and access to treatment on Stakeholders' Round Table Meeting (RTM)
for welfare of rare disease patients in Rajasthan.
A rare disease is a life
threatening or chronically debilitating condition that affects a very small
number of people.According to a book - Rare diseases in paediatrics, written by
Dr Ashok Gupta, JK Lon superintendent, "It is estimated that more than 7,000
distinct rare diseases exist today, affecting patients in their physical
capabilities, mental abilities, behaviour and sensorial capacities.
"The names of
some of rare diseases are Gaucher Type I, Fabry's disease, Pompe disease, MPS-I
(Hurler disease), MPS-II (Hunter disease), MPS-VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome
).Jaipur: Lysosomal Storage Disorders Support Society (LSDSS) has appealed to

AWARENESS Rare Disease Day is an awareness campaign that takes place on the last
day of February every year.
There are 7000 types of rare diseases and disorders.
50 per cent of the people affected by rare diseases are children.
30 per cent of children affected by a rare disease may not live to see their 5th
birthday.
95 per cent of rare diseases don't have a single approved drug treatment.
--------------------

Jack Peacock is one of two people in New Zealand who suffers from Hunter
syndrome - a life- threatening and debilitating genetic disease.
Speaking to the Manawatu Standard on Rare Disease Day yesterday, his mother,
Kirsty Taylor, said Jack was an intelligent kid who loved history, the universe,
facts and figures, and computer games.
"I'd never really talked to him about the fact his disease was terminal, because
for a very long time there I believed, wholeheartedly, that getting him
treatment would give him the opportunity to live a longer life.
"Jack's been on medication for four years now and without it he
wouldn't be here, but he's a lucky one to get the treatment he needs, because
there's so many people with rare diseases that don't."
Rare Disease Day was important because it built a sense of community and
camaraderie among sufferers and their families, she said.
"For so many [suffering] rare diseases on their own they're not even known
about, but as a collective [it's better] .
Jack's family is holding a black-tie "School Prom at The Grand" fundraiser this
Saturday for Rare Disease Day.

Mother fights daughter's rare disease

LENGTH: 887  words


IN OCTOBER 2012, 41-year-old Joselyn Taruc finally learned that her 2-year-old
daughter Queen Zina is afflicted with Hurler Syndrome, a rare and progressive
genetic disorder that causes her to develop a large head, dark skin, coarse
facial features (bulging forehead, depressed nasal bridge, broad mouth, square
jaw), short neck, enlarged abdomen, clawed hands, crouched stance and to suffer
from vision impairment, hearing loss and stunted growth.
The outlook for children with Hurler Syndrome is grim: they suffer from organ
dysfunction particularly of the heart (valve problems and narrowed arteries),
bones (misshapen spine and joints), lungs (frequent infection, airway blockages,
sleep apnea) and in some cases of the brain (developmental abnormalities,
learning difficulties and intellectual disabilities).
She has to keep on fighting for her health as I will keep
on fighting for access to treatment for her disease, said Taruc whose 6-year-old
first-born son died from complications of cerebral palsy in 2006.
Largely ignored

A rare disease like what Queen Zina has is largely ignored due to poor economic
potential and are thus said to be orphaned.
It is not surprising for most
biomedical research companies to focus on developing treatments for common
diseases as this would maximize the possibility of them recouping research and
development costs.
As a result, the gap between common- and rare-diseases drugs eventually widened
to the point where few or no treatments were available for rare conditions.
Taruc said: In my conversations with doctors, I found that a bone-marrow or
cord-blood transplant is the only treatment at the moment that shows promise
against the effects of Hurler Syndrome.
Besides, it may not undo the damage the disease has already done.
Fortunate

She related that she was just fortunate that when she sought the assistance of
doctors at the Philippine Children's Medical Center and the Philippine Society
for Orphan Disorders, she was referred to the University of the
Philippines-National Institutes of Health's Institute of Human Genetics, which
in turn, helped Queen Zina include in Genzyme's International Charitable Access
program (Genzyme is one of the few companies that developed life-saving
therapies for ultra-rare diseases).
We regularly visit
all her 10 specialists and despite my husband's meager pay as a truck driver, I
see to it that my baby gets treatment on time so I borrow money from friends or
seek financial assistance from charitable institutions.
Lacks enzyme

Hurler Syndrome occurs when the body lacks a particular enzyme that breaks down
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), a type of sugar molecule utilized by our cells to
help build bones, cartilages, tendons, corneas of the eyes, skin and other types
of connective tissues.
In children with Hurler Syndrome, the GAGs are not broken down completely and as
a result, accumulate in the cells.
The ERT mimics the missing enzyme and during infusion, it stops the progressive
accumulation of GAGs, resulting in the delay of Hurler Syndrome's progression in
the organs most affected by this disease.
Taruc and the rest of parents with children suffering from rare disorders are
currently depending on a handful individuals and companies for various support.
For years several bills, which seek to establish a comprehensive and sustainable
health system for rare diseases, have remained pending before both houses of
Congress.
Hurler Syndrome is inherited, which means the disease is passed on by the
parents to their child.
If both parents carry the defective gene related to this
condition, each of their children has a 25 percent chance of developing the
disease.
Persons with Hurler Syndrome do not make a substance called lysosomal
alpha-L-iduronidase.

Rossendale parents call on NHS to provide key treatment

BYLINE: Chris Adams

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 401 words


THE parents of a Rossendale boy who battled a deadly syndrome for more than a
decade have urged people to sign a petition calling for the NHS to treat ultra-
rare diseases.
Elizabeth and Jason Heath, whose son Jack died last June after fighting MPS II
Hunter syndrome for 11 years, said the current scoring system for NHS treatment
was "biased".
A spokeswoman for the charity said: "We want to reinstate the highly specialised
services and ultra-orphan drug appraisal process for children and adults with
ultra-rare diseases that the NHS dismantled on April 1, 2013.
"Through dialogue with Jeremy Hunt and patients' constituency MPs, we advised
NHS England that reorganisation would fail people in England with with ultra-
rare diseases and sadly how right we are."
The petition, which currently has almost 6,700 signatures, reads: "We have
started a petition about the discriminatory process set by NHS England that
denies access to treatments for ultra-rare disease due to its biased scoring.
"Whilst new therapies are expensive for children and adults with ultra-orphan
diseases, the numbers affected in England are usually in the tens and never
total more than 500 affected individuals.
"These ultra-rare diseases affect many organs of the body and usually result in
death in childhood or early adulthood.
"Today, even though the European Medicines Agency gave marketing approval for an
Enzyme Replacement Therapy for children and young adults with Morquio's syndrome
in April 2014 - and the health departments in France, Germany, Austria, Italy
and even Turkey are paying for Morquio's sufferers to receive Enzyme Replacement
Therapy - 77 people in England are denied Enzyme Replacement Therapy and have to
be treated at home."

Nearly 1 in 10 Americans suffers from a rare disease or disorder, according to
the National Institutes of Health.
Self-starters

When Donna Appell's daughter, Ashley, was diagnosed as an infant with
Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS), she had trouble finding much information about
the genetic terminal disease.
So she launched the nonprofit HPS Syndrome Network
in 1992, a support group for people and families dealing with the disease and
related disorders.
The disease, which can cause albinism, vision disorders, bleeding problems,
colitis and pulmonary fibrosis, affects an average of 1 in 500,000 to
100,000,000 people, but Appell says research can help many.
"When you study a rare disease, you actually benefit the [more] common ones,"
she says.
"[By studying] HPS, you study vision disorders, Crohn's disease,
pulmonary fibrosis and more."
Both are rare neuromuscular disorders that cause
debilitating pain throughout the body.
HSP may be genetic and is rarely fatal,
and PLS can be fatal, although doctors are unsure for now of how Richardson's
case will progress.

When Donna Appell's daughter, Ashley, was diagnosed as an infant with
Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS), she had trouble finding much information about
the genetic terminal disease.
So she launched the nonprofit HPS Syndrome Network
in 1992, a support group for people and families dealing with the disease and
related disorders.
The disease, which can cause albinism, vision disorders, bleeding problems,
colitis and pulmonary fibrosis, affects an average of 1 in 500,000 to
100,000,000 people, but Appell says research can help many.
"When you study a rare disease, you actually benefit the [more] common ones,"
she says.
"[By studying] HPS, you study vision disorders, Crohn's disease,
pulmonary fibrosis and more."
Both are rare neuromuscular disorders that cause
debilitating pain throughout the body.
HSP may be genetic and is rarely fatal,
and PLS can be fatal, although doctors are unsure for now of how Richardson's
case will progress.

Ontario needs better strategy to treat rare diseases, MPP Michael Harris says

Sometimes they think cancer would have been easier - at least then, they would
know what treatment to seek.
That's the mindset that emerges for some people who battle a rare disease, after
they discover that care or medicine needed to live a normal life - or just
survive - fall outside what Ontario can provide.
People with uncommon conditions like
Erdheim-Chester disease, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome or
Miller-Dieker syndrome often don't know what to do, he says - and the province's
medical system often doesn't know either.
To fix that, Harris has proposed a private member's motion that calls for a new
committee composed of politicians from all parties to spend time hearing from
doctors, patients, and drug companies.
After that, they would create
recommendations for better funding and policies to treat rare diseases in
Ontario.
Harris was in Kitchener Feb. 19 to hear people with rare diseases share their
stories.
"Until I was elected, I didn't really know anyone with a rare disease.
But I sat
at Queen's Park watching people come through the door... begging the health
minister for a treatment for their loved ones," he said.
Rare diseases may not be so rare.
According to the Canadian Organization for
Rare Disease, one in 12 Canadians are affected (or impacted) by rare disorders.
And there are thousands of rare diseases and conditions, Harris said, but they
lead to similar experiences for people navigating a system that's oftennot ready
for them.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, for example, is a condition that can
cause lung disease and liver disease.
The problem is not just getting access to a rare drug, it's the fact that an
obscure condition is often missed or misdiagnosed because doctors don't know how
to recognize it.
Harris admits he isn't sure exactly what the government's role should be to help
people with rare conditions, but he's optimistic the committee he has proposed
can find improvements

"Ontario has always been seen as a leader...so let's lead the way," he said.

Utah: NIH scientists pursue new therapies to improve rare disease drug
development

LENGTH: 807  words

DATELINE: Salt Lake City


National Institutes of Health, The State of Utah has issued the following news
release:

Four new pre-clinical drug development projects at the National Institutes of
Health will target a form of blindness and diseases characterized by cardiac
problems.
The projects were selected for their potential to treat specific rare
diseases and to help scientists uncover new information that can be shared with
other researchers.
The studies will be funded through the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected
Diseases (TRND) program at the NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational
Sciences (NCATS).
This group of projects also marks the TRND program's first use
of stem cells as well as its first collaboration with a large pharmaceutical
company, Eli Lilly, to co-develop a treatment for a rare disease.
Two projects employ therapeutic approaches to developing a treatment for
retinitis pigmentosa, a severe form of hereditary blindness.
A third project
focuses on a potential treatment for hypoparathyroidism, a hormone-deficiency
syndrome that can lead to cardiac problems and convulsions.
The remaining project aims to develop a possible therapeutic that targets a
cardiac disorder associated with LEOPARD syndrome, an extremely rare genetic
disease that affects many areas of the body.
About 80 percent of patients with
LEOPARD syndrome have a cardiac disorder called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder
to pump blood, which can lead to early death.
A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 Americans.
NIH estimates
that, in total, there are more than 6,000 rare diseases.
However, effective
pharmacologic treatments exist for only about 200 of these illnesses.
Private companies often do not pursue new therapies for rare diseases due to the
low anticipated return on investment.
Through TRND, NCATS advances potential
treatments for rare and neglected tropical diseases to first-in-human trials, an
approach known as "de-risking."
The new projects are:
Long-acting parathyroid hormone analog for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism

Henry U. Bryant, Ph.D., distinguished research fellow
Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis
Use of rapamycin for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in patients
with LEOPARD syndrome

Maria I. Kontaridis, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston
Use of retinal progenitor cells for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa

Henry J. Klassen, M.D., Ph.D., director, Stem Cell and Retinal Regeneration
Program
University of California, Irvine School of Medicine
Small molecule pharmacological chaperone for the treatment of retinitis
pigmentosa

William F. Brubaker, Ph.D., chief executive officer
Bikam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.
The collaborative project teams receive
in-kind support and gain access to TRND researchers with rare disease drug
development capabilities, expertise, and clinical and regulatory resources.
"We are particularly excited about this set of collaborative projects for its
potential to produce treatments for underserved patient populations," said John
C. McKew, Ph.D., acting director of NCATS Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation
and director of the TRND program.
A number of early projects fostered by TRND have reached the stage where
partners, such as pharmaceutical, biotechnology or disease groups, are being
sought to move the treatments out of TRND and in the next phases of clinical
development.
Through the program in the last two years, TRND researchers and
collaborators have advanced four projects to human clinical trials, evaluating
treatments for sickle cell disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hereditary
inclusion body myopathy and Niemann-Pick Type C.

Rare diseases place a collective burden on the health service

LENGTH: 414  words


It is estimated that 300,000 people in Scotland and 3.5million in the UK will be
affected by rare disease at some time in their lives.
Collectively, rare diseases are not rare and together they represent a
significant health burden to the NHS.
Eighty per cent of rare disease is of
genetic origin.
The health service was set up in 1948 when little was known about genetic
disease, and in many instances the NHS is failing patients who wait sometimes
five to 20 years for diagnosis.
I am a carrier of Fragile X and am the first woman in the UK to be diagnosed
with FXTAS (Fragile X Associated Tremor Ataxic Syndrome).
In my family there are
two children and one adult diagnosed with Fragile X Syndrome, also several
carriers in several generations of this genetically-inherited learning
disability disorder.
Since 2000 it has been
recognised that 48 per cent of carrier males - in 2004, 10/14 per cent of
carrier females - will go on to develop degenerative neurological symptoms
similar and sometimes referred to as "a Parkinson-like condition" called FXTAS.
How many medical professionals have ever heard of this condition?
Scotland has a leading research facility established two years ago at the
Patrick Wild Centre within Edinburgh University which conducts clinical trials
into Fragile X, autism and other neurological conditions.
Health care professionals and the general public need to be aware of the
difficulties for subsequent generations and the continuing burden to both health
and education services if this condition continues to go unrecognised.
Children with this condition need to get early diagnosis and early intervention
to enable them to have the best possible outcomes.

JAMIE Logan was eight weeks old when doctors told his parents he could develop a
grotesque and rare disease like the one portrayed in the movie The Elephant Man.
And US researchers have told the family
that Jamie, now 3, "almost certainly" will not develop McCune Albright Syndrome,
a rare disease with symptoms similar to the elephant man's disease.
One of the US doctors, Dr William Schwindinger, said if the tests had found
Jamie had the syndrome he would have led an awful life with multiple tumours
weakening his bones and causing fractures which would have made the boy
wheelchair bound.
Jamie underwent two weeks of tests in the US and is only one of seven children
the world renowned research centre has studied with the syndrome.
Dr Schwindinger said the syndrome was believed to be caused by a mutation in a
gene shortly after conception.

Rare diseases are the'orphans' of the medical world;
We know what the problem is, but somehow 'cost-effectiveness' rings hollow when
it's your child who is sick.

Stephen James suffers from symptoms that are as extreme as they are rare: food
cravings that compel him to take bolt cutters to the kitchen pantry that his
parents have locked, or even a screwdriver to a padlocked freezer.
His eating compulsion is due to Prader-Willi syndrome, which is caused by a gene
missing on part of chromosome 15.
Morbid obesity is one of its biggest medical
challenges and many of those with the syndrome - at least 300 in Canada - have
diminished muscle tone and decreased mental capacity, with sex glands that
produce little or no hormones.
Orphan medicine -
treatment for a life-threatening or chronically debilitating rare condition -
cost the James's private health insurer $50,000 annually, while treatments for
other diseases can cost up to $1-million a year.
"It's a full-time job raising a child with Prader-Willi syndrome," said his
mother, Susan James of Brantford, Ont.
The cost
might be a deterrent, but the number of Canadians with rare diseases is
relatively low.
The drug bills consume about .07 per cent of all public money
spent on pharmaceuticals, according to Durhane Wong-Rieger, president of the
Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders.
Though the argument over rare diseases often comes down to money, the issue is
not necessarily defined by the estimated $82-million Canadians spend annually on
orphan drugs.
With no national plan, obtaining treatment is "hit and miss," she said.
And yet other countries - Japan, Australia, the United States and the European
Union - have found ways to deal with orphan diseases.
In the United Kingdom, a
licensed therapy and a diagnosis is usually enough to qualify patients for fully
funded drugs.
Some fast-track drugs for rare diseases,
while others extend market exclusivity to pharmaceutical manufacturers or
provide tax incentives for drug companies to generate new treatments.
The core of the issue is the rarity of the disease: The fewer the number of the
affected, the less likely there will be a clinical trial study to prove a drug's
effectiveness.
And most drug manufacturers aiming to generate blockbuster
products to treat large numbers of patients do not find orphan drugs especially
attractive.
A key component of an orphan drug plan, say experts, would include a commitment
to evaluate patients through registries where clinical data is collected.
Of all the provinces, Alberta and Ontario are the furthest along; Alberta funds
treatments for rare diseases that in some cases, can run up to $1-million
annually.
Ontario is leading a national framework to develop consistent, evidence-based
approaches to evaluating drug therapies for rare diseases.
"These diseases are so rare that in a country our size, we really do all have to
be working together to put the best collective intelligence on the assessment,"
said Diane McArthur, executive officer of the Ontario Public Drug Programs.
In the case of Stephen James, who has Prader-Willi syndrome, his mother is
planning to put him through the necessary testing to see if he qualifies for the
growth hormone to be funded by the Ontario government.
Even defining rare diseases is not agreed upon.
The Canadian Organization for
Rare Disorders say it's 1 in 2,000; Alberta defines it as fewer than 1 in
50,000.
Ontario's working definition of rare is 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 150,000.
In the case of Prader-Willi syndrome, it is estimated to afflict roughly 1 in
22,000 births, said Jean-Pierre Chanoine, division head of endocrinology and
diabetes at BC Children's Hospital.
These rare diseases which are often genetic can be so overwhelming, there seems
no hope.
When treatments do exist, they are not magic bullets, but ways to halt
the disease progression or quell its symptoms.
Dr. Chanoine pointed out that doctors cannot fix a problem caused by a genetic
condition.
"You cannot replace the gene or modify it to make the condition to
disappear," he said, adding that treatment often involves helping patients cope
with their condition.

What is rare?
Orphan diseases are rare, and agreement on a definition among countries or even
provinces is equally unique.
Here is the range of medical opinion on the numbers
of patients involved.
The Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders: 1 in 2,000

Alberta: fewer than one in 50,000 people or fewer than 50

Ontario: ranges from 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 150,000

United Kingdom: fewer than 5 in 10,000

United States: fewer than 5 in 10,000

Australia: fewer than 2,000

Japan: fewer than 50,000

THE U.K.

One system that seems to work

The United Kingdom is heralded for its comprehensive way of treating orphan
diseases, where it has a system of evaluating and funding drugs for rare
conditions.
"In most situations where there is a licensed therapy, most patients will
eventually get the drug once they have a confirmed diagnosis," said Alastair
Kent, director of Genetic Alliance UK, a national charity of patient
organizations supporting those affected by genetic disorders.
Prader-Willi syndrome is a good example: Patients have been obtaining growth
hormone for almost nine years since the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence ruled in favour of it, saying it was a "clinically and
cost-effective way to treat children with growth hormone deficiency."
Compare that to Canada, where patients struggle to obtain the drug: They go
without the growth hormone, try to get it funded through their work health
plans, or apply to receive it at no cost under compassionate grounds from
pharmaceutical companies.
In the U.K., there are different routes to funding rare diseases, defined there
as affecting fewer than 5 out of 10,000 people.
But no matter the route, the drugs are government funded with no co-payments to
patients.
Recommendations to fund these licensed medicines are made after being
carefully studied and having agreed upon clinical protocols created by doctors
who treat the rare disease or condition.
One downside is finding that physician who can provide a definitive diagnosis
and get treatment rolling.

Registry formed for rare diseases

BYLINE: Neetu Chandra Sharma

Indian Council of Medical Research hopes it will help determine the accurate
number of patients

New Delhi: India now finally has a rare disease registry.
To get a better
estimate of the number of patients suffering from rare diseases, the Indian
Council of Medical Research (ICMR) set up the registry on April 28.
The registry will ascertain the number of patients suffering from rare diseases,
and formulate policies on resources, funding and treatment.
"A disease or a disorder is defined as rare in India when it affects less than
one in 2,500 individuals.
The registry intends to cover the spectrum of rare and
ultra-rare disorders.
However, initially it will only gather data on conditions
for which an established treatment process is available," said Dr Soumya
Swaminathan, Director General, ICMR, and Secretary, Department of Health
Research, Union Health Ministry.
According to ICMR officials, the registry will help determine the "precise
number of patients, age of onset of symptoms, age of diagnosis, the course of
the disease, etc."
ICMR has also contacted patient groups managed by organisations such as Indian
RETT Syndrome Foundation, Indian Society for Primary Immune Deficiency, Society
for Hemophilia Care India, Organisation of Rare Disorders India, Lysosomal
Storage Disorder Support Society, Metabolic Errors and Rare Disease Organisation
of India, Hemophilia Federation of India, and The Fragile X Society India.
"Awareness about rare diseases is considerably low in India.
This can help detect
Fragile X syndrome and other rare disorders among children early on," said
Shalini Kedia, Founding Chairperson, The Fragile X Society.
More than 70 million people in India suffer from various rare diseases that
manifest in childhood, and remain with them throughout their lives.

A FIVE-year-old Mareeba boy with a flair for performance and a personality
beyond his years, has demonstrated the power of determination to not let his
rare disease slow him down.
Liam Chapman, who turns five today, has been diagnosed with Prader-Willi
Syndrome.
The vibrant youngster has been chosen as the ambassador of this year's Rare
Disease Day Fun Run and Walk.
The annual walk, ride and run is held to support locals affected by rare disease
and to commemorate International Rare Disease Day.
Mrs Chapman said over the past three years, Liam had
walked in the event with his friend, Ivy Barsley, a seven-year-old Mareeba girl
who has rare chromosome syndrome called Partial Trisomy 10 Partial Monosomy 4.
Mrs Chapman
encouraged Tablelands residents to take part in this year's Rare Disease Day
event.
Funds raised will go towards research and support for locals with rare disease.

Record View: NHS must deliver the best care for people with rare diseases;
LIVING with a rare disease is an incredibly difficult ordeal.
But, for some people, being struck with a rare disease can lead to
misunderstanding, misdiagnosis and very painful medical treatment.
Living with a rare disease is an incredibly difficult ordeal.
About 300,000 people in Scotland are diagnosed with rare diseases and almost a
third of sufferers will die before their fifth birthday - so an ordeal can
become a tragedy, too.
Having a rare disease can be a struggle emotionally, financially and socially as
well as clinically.
The lack of scientific knowledge and quality information on diseases often
results in a delay in diagnosis.
The need for proper health care poses challenges in terms of access to
treatment.
Today, we profile several rare conditions and talk to some of the Scots who
suffer from them.
They are faced with making life-changing decisions on life-threatening
conditions, of which little is understood.
These are people like eight-year-old Ava Jolliffe, who has the extremely rare
Brown-Vialetto Van Laere syndrome.
It is a life-limiting genetic disease which causes damage to nerves at the base
of the brain.
It can cause deterioration in much the same way as motor neurone disease.
Brother and sister Alasdair and Chloe Taylor both suffer from Fragile X syndrome
- a genetic condition which causes a range of developmental problems, including
learning disabilities and cognitive impairment.
The fact that there are often no existing effective cures for these conditions
and many others adds to the high level of pain and anguish endured by patients
and their families.
That's why the Daily Record are lending our support to Rare Diseases Day - to
raise awareness, join the campaign to make sure that sufferers have access to
effective services and to ensure that patients and their families and carers are
listened to and understood.
There is never going to be enough money to meet all the demands placed on the
NHS but they can deliver the best care possible for every individual, whatever
their circumstances and however challenging their condition.
More care, more understanding and more clinical and scientific research can make

World's spotlight falls on rare diseases;
The lack of awareness is big challenge

ONE IN 10 people across the globe is affected by a rare condition.
Today the
world, including South Africa, will mark the 10th annual Rare Disease Day.
According to statistics released by Rare Diseases South Africa (RDSA), about 50%
of people affected by rare diseases are children.
Taking this further, about 30% will not live past their fifth birthday, with
rare diseases also being responsible for 35% of deaths in the first year of
life.
It's estimated that in South Africa, roughly 3.6â[#x20ac]...million people are
affected by rare diseases, while worldwide the number of sufferers is estimated
at 350â[#x20ac]...million.
As part of a worldwide campaign to raise awareness for patients, families and
carers who are affected by rare diseases, Rare Disease Day takes place on the
last day of February every year.
This year's global theme is "Research", a topic that is close to the hearts of
everyone who seeks to bring hope to people who are living with a rare condition.
There are about 7â[#x20ac]...000 rare diseases.
The most common in South Africa
include the auto-immune disorder Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome; connective tissue
diseases such as Marfan syndrome and scleroderma; as well as neurofibromatosis,
which is a genetic disorder that causes tumours to form on nerve tissue; and
Turner syndrome, a chromosomal condition that affects development in females.
"Rare diseases are often difficult to diagnose and treat, but through research
they provide a window into the way our bodies work," says Professor Michele
Ramsay, the director and research chair at the Sydney Brenner Institute for
Molecular Bioscience, University of the Witwatersrand.
In Africa, rare diseases have not been widely studied and there are
numerous people who remain undiagnosed.
This, in turn, may lead us to better treatment and management of the condition,"
she says.
"It is important for families affected by rare diseases to know they are not
alone."
"Researchers benefit from studying groups of people with similar rare diseases
because they can put together the different pieces of a puzzle to understand the
mechanisms that lead to the disorder.
Rare diseases are individually rare and diverse, and research needs to be
international to ensure that experts, researchers and clinicians are connected,
that clinical trials are multinational, and that patients can benefit from the
pooling of resources across borders.
This wheelchair-friendly event gave people the opportunity to get up and
physically do something for those suffering with rare conditions.
It also gave
patients suffering from rare diseases the opportunity to meet and interact with
one another.
RDSA helps patients to access life-saving treatment and supportive care for
improved quality of life.
RDSA focuses on educating the public about these medical conditions.
"The main objective of Rare Disease Day, and the Denim Walk, is to raise
awareness among the public and decision-makers about rare diseases and their
impact on patients' lives," says Kelly du Plessis, the chief executive of RDSA.
Du Plessis adds that Rare Disease Day has taken place since 2008, and events are
now held in more than 80 countries.
"The campaign also targets policymakers, public authorities, industry
representatives, researchers, health professionals and anyone who has a genuine
interest in rare diseases.
"While we realise that many of these conditions are years away from having
targeted treatments, it is never too late to make our patients feel as though
their lives matter," she stresses.
According to Ramsay, about 80% of rare diseases are genetic and are often
chronic and life-threatening.
"This is why RDSA works in partnership with Genetic Alliance South Africa
(GA-SA), an organisation that focuses on rare and common disorders with a
genetic basis.
Together we aim to make a difference to awareness of rare diseases in South
Africa," she says.
Rare diseases are characterised by a broad diversity of disorders and symptoms
that vary not only from disease to disease, but also from patient to patient.
Relatively common symptoms can hide underlying rare diseases, leading to
misdiagnosis and delaying treatment.
"Among the greatest challenges for parents and children living with rare
diseases isâ[#x20ac]¨the lack of awareness and understanding from those around
them, difficulty in obtaining an accurate diagnosis, the feeling of being
isolated, and the financial toll that illness takes on families," explains Du
Plessis.
"The fact that there are often no existing effective cures adds to the high
level of pain and suffering endured by patients and their families.
"These patients' quality of life is affected by the lackâ[#x20ac]¨or loss of
autonomy due toâ[#x20ac]¨the chronic, progressive, degenerative and frequently
life-threatening aspects of their disease, which are essentially disabling," she
adds.
"We urge people to support those living with rare diseases by volunteering at
our events, donating to our projects, swimming, cycling or running for rare
diseases, and helping us to create greater awareness by educating those around
you," Du Plessis says.

INSPIRATIONAL Torbay charity Alström Syndrome UK has won an international
accolade to mark its pioneering work in Europe.
The Paignton-based charity was
set up in a front room in Southfield Avenue by a mum who lost both her children
to the rare disease.
Alström Syndrome is a very
rare inherited condition, which affects the body's metabolism with particular
impact on all major organs including the heart, lungs, kidneys and liver.
During childhood, patients suffer deteriorating eyesight, often leading to
blindness.
"It doesn't make me angry, it just makes me sad that people with very rare
diseases have been forgotten in the system and still are.
"Rare Diseases Day is held in Britain this week to draw attention to the fact
that one in 17 people are affected by a rare disease - that's more than are
affected by cancer cumulatively, but because each individual disease is rare,
they do not get the publicity."
It also strengthens our resolve to keep on
fighting to gain more recognition for rare diseases in Europe and around the
world."
The award for patient care was given by EURORDIS, the European Organisation for
Rare Diseases, a non-governmental alliance of patient organisations and
individuals dedicated to improving the quality of life for people living with
rare diseases in Europe.

NPS Pharmaceuticals Observes Rare Disease Day 2012

LENGTH: 955  words


New Delhi, March 3 -- NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: NPSP), a specialty
pharmaceutical company developing orphan therapeutics for rare gastrointestinal
and endocrine disorders, is joining the National Organization for Rare Disorders
(NORD) and other organizations around the world today to observe World Rare
Disease Day on February 29, 2012.
This observance spotlights the nearly 30
million people in the United States and millions more worldwide who are living
with a rare disorder, many of whom have difficulty getting the right care
because of a lack of education about these conditions.
"Rare Disease Day reminds us that there are millions of people who are waiting
for treatments for their rare disorders," said Francois Nader, M.D., president
and chief executive officer of NPS Pharmaceuticals.
"As a company dedicated to
developing treatments for orphan gastrointestinal and endocrine disorders, NPS
salutes the researchers, patients, advocates, and healthcare providers who are
working tirelessly to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those
affected by rare disorders."
In the U.S., any disease affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans is considered
rare.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), there are
approximately 7,000 such diseases affecting nearly 30 million Americans.
While
nearly one in 10 Americans lives with a rare disease, only about 200 of the
diseases classified as rare have FDA-approved treatments.
"Everyone knows someone with a rare disease but many don't appreciate the
support these patients need," said Peter L. Saltonstall, president and CEO of
NORD.
"We have been celebrating Rare Disease Day for five years, and in that
time it has become a truly global movement.
With the help of partners such as
NPS Pharmaceuticals, we can empower people on nearly every continent to ensure
that patients living with rare diseases are heard."
About Rare Disease Day

Launched in Europe five years ago, World Rare Disease Day was recognized last
year in 60 countries, each of which has a national sponsor.
NORD is the sponsor
in the U.S.

On Rare Disease Day 2012, activities in the U.S. will include a "Handprints
Across America" campaign to create a gallery of photos on the Rare Disease Day
website; educational materials for classroom teachers; and a nationwide blitz of
patient photos, stories and videos to increase awareness of specific rare
diseases and the challenges of living with a rare disease.
In addition, several
special events are planned, including a scientific symposium at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and a Rare Disease Patient Advocacy Day in
conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In the U.S., the coalition supporting Rare Disease Day includes patient
organizations and advocacy groups, medical professionals and associations,
government agencies, researchers, and companies developing treatments for rare
diseases.
More than 500 patient organizations, government entities, research
institutions, and companies developing treatments have signed up as Rare Disease
Day Partners on the national website hosted by NORD (www.rarediseaseday.us).
About Short Bowel Syndrome

Short bowel syndrome, or SBS, is a highly disabling condition that can lead to
serious life-threatening complications and impair a patient's quality-of-life.
SBS typically arises after extensive resection of the bowel due to Crohn's
disease, ischemia or other conditions.
As a
result, many patients require the chronic use of parenteral nutrition (PN) and
intravenous (IV) fluids to supplement their nutritional needs and stabilize
their hydration.
The
development of PN-associated liver disease predisposes patients to an increased
incidence of sepsis, increased mortality rates, and the potential to develop
irreversible liver damage.
There are an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 SBS patients in the U.S. who are
dependent on parenteral nutrition and intravenous fluids.
About Hypoparathyroidism

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder in which the body produces insufficient
levels of parathyroid hormone, the principal regulator of calcium and
phosphorus.
It is one of the few remaining hormone
deficiency syndromes in which replacement therapy using the native hormone is
not clinically available.

SIX-year-old Molly Cross is a happy little girl with a very rare disease, so
rare in fact that only one in 15,000 people have it.
Angelman Syndrome is a neuro-genetic disorder which has only recently entered
the public view, with the second ever International Angelman day taking place on
Saturday.
With statistics showing that more people in the Far North must have Angleman
Syndrome, she is keen to reach out to others in need.
Next weekend will be the sixth fun run for International Rare Disease Day to be
held on the Cairns Esplanade.
The three or five kilometre course can be done as a walk or run, with proceeds
going to rare disease awareness and research.

Rare disease nearly kills West Cameron Twp.
SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 979 words


Aug. 15--WEST CAMERON TOWNSHIP- It has been six years since John Hornberger, 56,
of West Cameron Township, experienced unimaginable pain and nearly died from a
disease that most medical professionals have never heard of before:
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.
Today, Hornberger looks at the scars on his body with
his partially damaged eyesight, and is determined to raise enough awareness
about the rare disease to help others avoid the suffering he felt.
"It's only rare if you don't have it," said Hornberger.
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is an adverse drug reaction that causes painful
blistering of the skin.
A person's eyesight
is also threatened by the disease that causes severe conjunctivis, iritis,
palpebral edema, conjunctival and corneal blisters and erosions, and corneal
perforation.
The disease can be triggered by ingredients found in simple over-the-counter
medications.
A foreign doctor, who was on duty at Shamokin Area Community Hospital
emergency room, said the rash looked like a disease he had seen in his home
country, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.
Unable to be treated at the Shamokin facility, Hornberger was transported to
Geisinger Medical Center in Danville while his sister, Ellen Reed, researched
the disease online and found the Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Foundation.
Reed said the doctors didn't pay much attention to what she told them about the
disease and transported Hornberger by Life Flight to the burn center at the
Lehigh Valley Hospital when Geisinger staff was unable to treat him.
"Even the doctors are unaware
about the disease and don't know how to treat it.
Doctors were eventually able to save Hornberger's skin, but the scars of the
disease are evident all over his body.
"Most people who have the disease end up blind and deaf," said Hornberger.
Raising awareness

Hornberger is convinced that he would not be alive today if it weren't for the
support of his family, his faith and the Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Foundation
that provided him with information about the rare disease.
As soon as he could, he called Jean McCawley, founder of the Stevens-Johnson
Foundation, to tell her that if it had not been for her foundation providing
information about the disease, he would not be around to tell his story.
Medical professionals still do not know what causes the disease and there is
currently no way to tell who is more likely to get it.
One of the goals of the organization is to encourage research of the disease.
Hornberger said that stem cell research may reveal more about the rare disease
and there are other promising treatments for the disease that are pending
approval for the market.
He writes letters to local lawmakers every year, asking them to make
August Stevens-Johnson Syndrome awareness month.
"There's a saying that the organization likes to use: 'Find out about
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome before it finds someone you love'," said Hornberger.

Doctors believe Brantley has a rare disease known as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.
Children with cases as severe as Brantley's are even rarer than the disease he
has.
Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a rare congenital disease, according to the U.S.
National Library of Medicine.
A disease is considered rare when it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the
U.S.
There are more than 6,800 known rare diseases that affect about 30 million
people in the U.S., according to the National Institutes of Health.
The syndrome is
estimated to affect at least one in 100,000 people worldwide, according to U.S.
National Library of Medicine.
He recovered from both diseases,
and he and his parents have been home for a few weeks.
Doctors believe the 3-month-old has
Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, a rare congenital disease.
Doctors believe Brantley has Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.
Ms. Latiff and thousands of others worldwide have a rare disease    called
Sjogren's Syndrome (pronounced Sho-grens), which diminishes the    production of
bodily fluids, such as tears and saliva.
People afflicted    with the disease
need daily doses of a medicine called Bromhexine to    lead normal lives.
Since being diagnosed with the rare disease two years ago, Latiff    has
been on a quest to make the drug available in the United States.
The disease can cause mouth
ulcers, tooth decay, bladder and yeast infections and vaginal dryness.
The malady is so rare it has not attracted enough attention to    generate
the financing necessary to find a cure.
Nor has Sjogren's    Syndrome affected
enough people in the United States to make it    attractive to manufacture the
drug here.
"It's a real cause for celebration," said Elaine Harris,    president of
the Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation, headquartered in Great    Neck, N.Y.
"We would not be at this point without (Ms.
Now Ms. Latiff    is a
consultant on the disease for the state and will be putting    together a
pamphlet for Florida doctors' offices so others may    recognize their symptoms
early.
Ms. Latiff - who was in Washington, D.C., this week and could not    be
reached for comment - will be the national Sjogrens delegate at the
conference on rare diseases in April.
She also is working toward the    first
American conference to focus exclusively on Sjogren's Syndrome.
The syndrome - named after a Swedish physician who discovered it in    1933
- is a disease that causes the body's immune system to react    against itself.
Although the symptoms can be    very painful,
the disease is rarely fatal, said Dr. Michael Rozboril of    Gainesville.
Just after her daughter Vayla was born, Ms Petersen, 25, was told her precious
new arrival had the syndrome, sometimes called "cry of the cat".
Sufferers have a chromosome missing and display similar characteristics to
people with the more common Down syndrome.
It affects about 1 in 35,000 to 1 in 50,000 people and is one of about 7000 rare
diseases spotlighted by the New Zealand Organisation for Rare Disorders" annual
awareness day.
The "cry of the cat" name comes from the distinctive noise people with cri du

Ms Petersen said Rare Diseases Day yesterday was about raising awareness of the
many little known and understood conditions people have.
Vayla has another rare condition, bronchiectasis, which damages the lungs"
ability to clear mucus and raises the risk of infection.
"What"s good about having Rare Diseases Day or any awareness day is people get
to understand that there are so many people out there that have differences."
NZ Organisation for Rare Disorders chief executive Letitia O"Dwyer said a rare
disorder or disease was something that 1 in 2000 or more people had and most
were genetic.

Five years ago, a passionate mother-turned-activist chatted up her tablemate at
a conference for people with genetic diseases.
On Friday, at McCarrell's invitation, Collins was at the Sheraton Philadelphia
serenading a room full of people affected by Moebius syndrome.
The rare genetic
condition causes facial paralysis and the inability to turn eyes left or right
in their sockets.
The presence of Collins, 62, at the Moebius Syndrome Conference points to a
growing national interest in rare diseases and the potential breakthroughs they
can bring not only for those conditions but for more common ones too.
"Although they are individually rare," Collins said, "if you put them all
together .
about 26 million people in the U.S. are affected by rare
diseases."
Research on rare conditions accounts for more than 11 percent of the
NIH budget, with $3.5 billion set aside.
But there are around 7,000 rare
diseases.
But his lab has analyzed the data of only four Moebius
patients, and there is still no known cause, much less a treatment.
The condition is present at birth.
Collins called research into rare diseases the "entryway into understanding
profoundly important issues and principles that will have implications far
beyond that individual rare disease."
He pointed to his own work on progeria, an exceedingly rare condition that
causes children to age rapidly and die of strokes and heart attacks as
teenagers.
When Simmons was born, her condition shocked her family.
The isolating experience and lack of answers are part of what inspired McCarrell
to start the Moebius Syndrome Foundation, the group behind this weekend's
conference.
Grassroots campaigns for rare diseases have grown with modern connectivity.
"The
Internet has increased the ability of patients to join together," said Stephen
Groft, director of the Office of Rare Diseases Research at NIH.

Rare Sjogren's Syndrome stumps Gandhi hospital doctors

HYDERABAD: Nearly 12 percent of the 670 patients checked during an awareness
programme at the state-run Gandhi hospital were found to have symptoms of
Sjogren's Syndrome, a rare disease which was unheard of in the city.
The disease
causes extreme dryness of eyes and mouth with patients needing to sip water or
liquids to be able to talk for even five minutes.
The disease is classified into
two types- rheumatoid Sjogrens syndrome (less common) and primary Sjogren's
Syndrome (rare).
Four patients suffering from the primary type were found during
the awareness drives conducted last month, but what is more alarming is that
most of the patients suffering from the symptoms are often misdiagnosed,
sometimes mistreated and almost always rounded off to psychiatrists.
"Awareness
about this rare disease is low even in the medical fraternity that the diagnosis
becomes the most difficult part.
The prevalence of this syndrome is four in 1 lakh population," said Dr Sirisha
Goud, member Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation and Society of Hospital Medicine,
USA, who was part of the awareness drive at Gandhi hospital.Apart from dryness
of mouth, redness of eyes, a constant sensation of having foreign particles in
the eyes, joint pains (in case of rheumatoid Sjogrens) and extreme fatigue ar
the other symptoms.
The syndrome affects multiple organs in the body leading to
vision loss, seizures and even stroke, if remained undetected for long.
The
disease affects the entire immune system and cannot be cured but can be
controlled with medicines, doctors said.Due to lack of awareness, patients
suffering from either type are mostly put on psychiatric medicines say experts.
"With diagnosis being difficult and the need to rule out all other tissue
diseases, by the time patients are referred to a rheumatologist, they are
already on psychiatric medicines.
Since the symptoms of the disease are very vague, in many cases they
are mistaken for either Vitamin D or Vitamin B 12 deficiency or psychiatric
illness," explains Dr Arindam Nandy Roy, senior consultant rheumatologist,
Yashoda Hospital, Secunderabad.Rheumatologists working for nearly two decades
have confirmed seeing just 15 to 16 cases of the primary type.

May 20--Fundraisers are being planned to help a local man diagnosed with
Guillain-Barre syndrome in 2011.
On Dec. 19, 2011, David was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a disorder
in which a person's immune system attacks their nervous system.
An uncommon disease, it only affects one or two out of every 100,000 people.

HEALTH;
At 4, big Max has already made his mark;
Path to diagnosis is one for the textbooks, and should help parents of children
born with Weaver syndrome and other rare diseases

BYLINE: ANDRÉ PICARD

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.
He has a rare disease that
has caused developmental delays and mobility issues, among other challenges.
But how he came to have a diagnosis - Weaver syndrome - will likely earn Max a
place in medical textbooks and the lore of genomics.
Then came repeated bouts of near-fatal pneumonia, seizures and the realization
that the boy had polymicrogyria, a condition in which the folds on the surface
of the brain are unusually small, causing developmental problems.
"It's an odyssey that parents of children with rare diseases know all too
well," said Clay Jones, Max's dad.
Genetic disorders are individually rare but collectively common.
All told, about
500,000 children in Canada have rare disorders that cause birth defects,
intellectual disabilities, difficulties with growth, or organ failure, often in
odd combinations.
In Canada, children are screened at birth for about two dozen rare but treatable
disorders (the number and type varies by province) but most genes that cause
rare diseases have not been identified.
It was clear that Max, given his size, had an overgrowth syndrome.
His parents,
in addition to being caregivers, became disease detectives, scouring medical
literature for clues.
"Max's condition is so
rare that we often know more than his doctors."
Max's parents became convinced
he had Weaver syndrome, a condition first reported in 1974, and so rare that
only 40 cases are found in medical literature.
One of few experts on Weaver syndrome was based in Vancouver, and he was a key
player in an initiative called FORGE (Finding Of Rare Disease Genes) Canada, a
consortium that is using advances in genomic technology to identify rare
childhood genetic disorders.
Children's
Hospital, and his team sequenced the entire genome of members of three families
with a child suspected of having Weaver syndrome (including the Joneses) and, by
comparing them, identified a mutation in a gene called EZH2 as the cause.
Max had that rare mutation.
The discovery means doctors now have a test for patients who show the symptoms
of the disorder.
For Max's parents, it was a relief, even though naming his condition does not
change anything.
Dr. Gibson said that after years working with families whose children have rare
conditions, he knows a definite, DNA-based diagnosis matters.
The genetic discovery also opens the door to research and, on Sunday, the
first-ever symposium on Weaver syndrome will be held in Vancouver.
The diagnosis raises further concern for the Jones family, because children with
Weaver syndrome have a much higher risk of developing cancers of the white blood
cells such as leukemia and lymphoma.

Support for Sanfilippo Syndrome sufferer

BYLINE: NICOLE CAIRNS

PURPLE may not be used in Ballarat Clarendon College's uniform, but students and
teachers donned a splash of the colour to raise money for Sanfilippo Syndrome on
Wednesday.
It is one of many ways the school will raise money for research into the rare
disease, which has attacked teacher Mark Robson's five-year-old daughter Skye.
School head of community service Jenny Tischler said the school supported things
close to home and the community, and students had pushed for something to be
done relating to the disease.
Skye's life expectancy is between 12 and 20 years, with the degenerative fatal
disease in its initial stages.
She said the college had chosen  a touch of purple as purple was the colour used
for rare diseases.
'Rare Disease Day was celebrated on February 28, which was a Saturday ' which
didn't suit us at school, so we decided to do something now,' she said.
Ms Tischler said the main aim of the week was to raise awareness for Sanfilippo
syndrome and hoped the whole school would know and understand something about it
by the end of the week.
'Hopefully, this will help find a cure for Skye and help others with the rare
disease.'

The lack of a support system for those with rare diseases needs to be remedied

FINDING OUT that a child not only has a disorder, but a a rare one at that, can
compound the grief and anger of parents and their sense of bewilderment.
It took nine years for Eithne Agar to find out about her son Robert's condition
and only then it was by chance.
Though a paediatrician suggested Robert had Sotos syndrome when he was born, he
was nine before seeing a specialist who also suggested the syndrome.
According to the medical textbooks, Sotos syndrome is more commonly called
cerebral gigantism because of the distinctive shape of the head of those who get
it.
The range and severity of the conditions are such, however,
that it be can permanently debilitating, or those who have it can grow up to
lead a normal life.
Other diseases such as cerebral palsy were almost
mentioned.
A
paediatrician visited Robert at the time and he mentioned Sotos syndrome.
Her experiences have caused her to endorse a proposal by Rehab Ireland for an
all-Ireland centre of excellence for rare diseases, something, she says, that
would "eliminate this cloud of unknowing and this nightmarish situation that
people find themselves in".
The proposal has arisen out of a study done by Rehab into the problems for
sufferers and their relatives and also GPs who have trouble accessing
information on diseases which they might only encounter once in their
professional lives.
The report highlights the need for a centralised information service to minimise
the risk of families who experience rare disorders accessing worst-case
scenarios, inaccurate and out-of-date information and feeling overwhelmed as a
result.
Rehab Care's director of policy and co-ordination, Sarah Jane Dillon, says rare
diseases are by definition not common, but taken together, it estimates that
about 365,000 people in Ireland, or more than 5 per cent of the total population
of the island, have one of the 7,000 rare diseases currently identified by the
medical profession.
She said that the nature of the diseases in question means there is frequently
an information vacuum for parents and GPs, and there is no local support group
for those who are looking for help with diseases which can often have a
devastating effect on families.
According to Rehab research, three-quarters of GPs have difficulty accessing
information about rare diseases, and often resort to the internet, the same tool
used by virtually every family nowadays trying to find out more information.
"There could be somebody in Donegal with the same condition as somebody else in
Donegal, and they might not know.
"In fact, it is exploding and there is no way that health professionals can
access all the information at the time- they can't be expert on every single
condition," she says.
Hoey says that such a centre could be funded by the State and through
fundraising, and would pay for itself in the long term by giving quicker
diagnosis and treatment and better support to hard-pressed families.

Brave Jack keeps battling rare disease

The mother of an 11-year-old boy diagnosed as the only person in Britain to
suffer from a rare disease that has left him with no immune system has spoken of
their struggle.
Jack Buchanan suffers from tricho hepato enteric (THE) syndrome which has only
ever been reported 40 times worldwide.
The majority of people that suffer from the disease die before the age of five
and no one with it has ever lived past their 21st birthday.
"It's very isolating as well, I've spoken to other parents in America and
Australia whose children have the same condition and they find it very difficult
because there is no support groups out there.
"If it was Down's syndrome or something similar then you could meet other
parents in a similar situation."
Ms Jones, 32, said she was desperate for a diagnosis but it was not until a
specialist mapped out his genes that they found a mutation which identified the
rare condition.
At the moment there is still no cure for the disease and Jack has spent many
months at a time at Bristol Children's Hospital.
The day also coincides with Rare Disease Day.
His condition means he gets tired very quickly and becomes ill if
he over exerts himself.
"We saw that Monday, February 29, was Rare Disease Day and it seemed like a
great time to support The Grand Appeal while helping raise awareness of such
rare conditions like THE.
The
treatment is based on the idea that using a large group of people, many will
have been infected by the majority of illnesses, which Jack's body can then use
to fight germs.
Laura Madams, community fundraiser for The Grand Appeal, said: "Every penny that
The Grand Appeal raises helps us to make sure Bristol Children's Hospital can
provide the very best care possible to young patients like Jack.
We are very
proud of the amazing doctors and nurses we have on our doorstep here in Bristol,
who have the knowledge  to care for children with such rare conditions."

Scientists find gene at root of rare disease

OKLAHOMA CITY - Scientists at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation and the
University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center have pinpointed the genetic
mutation behind a rare disease known as Adams-Oliver Syndrome.
Adams-Oliver Syndrome is an extremely rare disease, with only 100 cases reported
in medical literature.
Symptoms of the disease include scarring on the scalp,
defects of the hands and feet, shorter-than-average height and, in some cases,
mental deficiencies.
While the discovery of the mutated gene likely won't affect
the treatment of patients with the disease, it could be used for testing and
genetic counseling purposes.
"Knowing that it's Adams-Oliver Syndrome, even though there's no specific
treatment, means doctors will know about future symptoms and can plan for them,"
said Patrick Gaffney, OMRF researcher and the paper's senior author.
"If
patients know they have the disease, it can also help them make more informed
choices about family planning. "
The work, published online in The American Journal of Human Genetics, shows the
promise of using exome sequencing as a method of finding specific genes that
cause rare disorders, Gaffney said.
"Quality sleep has a significant impact on helping our patients fight their
cancer and improve their overall quality of life," said Larry Altshuler,
internist and director of oncology intake, who oversees the new lab.
"The sleep
lab will be a valuable adjunct in our efforts to combat a variety of symptoms
from cancer and its treatment, including insomnia, fatigue, narcotic side
effects and many more. "
The sleep lab allows patients to be evaluated for narcolepsy, sleep apnea and
other disorders.
The sleep lab is open for overnight studies three evenings a week and can
accommodate testing for six patients per week.

Children across the country will gather at Torbay Hospital at the first  clinic
for an extremely rare disease.
Clinicians will be joined by consultants at
Birmingham's Children's Hospital to pool the best of their knowledge for a new
combined clinic for teenagers diagnosed with a rare genetic condition, Alstrom
Syndrome.
As they grow to adolescence, multiple organ systems can be affected, resulting
in blindness, hearing impairment, type two diabetes, heart failure, liver
disease, urological dysfunction, pulmonary fibrosis, and renal failure.
Kay Parkinson, who has two children with the syndrome, has campaigned for better
support for 20 years.
Now the charity has set up the first  clinic for the syndrome and patients from
across the country are expected to attend to access the best medical knowledge
of the condition.
This
means patients will get specialist care by experts and we can learn more about
the disease and how to prevent the onset of various problems."
Mrs Parkinson said many of the 29 patients in the country have been diagnosed
late in life because many doctors have never seen the condition before.
The
clinic, which will bring together experts in the syndrome, will offer them the
best possible care and advice.
Torbay Hospital is the only one in the South West
to receive government funding to provide a national service for a rare disease.
They will be met by doctors and other health professionals from the two national
centres of expertise, Birmingham and Torbay, and together they will review the
effects of the syndrome on the youngsters' health and lives.
Consultants from several different specialities are brought together in one
place and can compare notes about the wide-ranging complications being
experienced by patients.
This approach is being taken one step further for
younger patients with the inclusion of paediatric experts from the country's
only other Alstrom treatment centre.
In addition, Torbay Hospital's Alstrom clinic was hailed earlier this year at an
international conference in Copenhagen as the way forward for treating rare
disorders, rather than specialists working in isolation, and patients being seen
in multiple clinics.
Dr Richard Paisey spoke at the convention, run by the European Organisation for
Rare Diseases, to an audience of participants from 24 countries.
Dr Paisey,
consultant in diabetes and endocrinology at Torbay Hospital, said: "There's hope
that understanding this rare condition will throw more light on the very common
problems of type two diabetes and heart disease."

Children across the country will gather at Torbay Hospital at the first  clinic
for an extremely rare disease.
Clinicians will be joined by consultants at
Birmingham's Children's Hospital to pool the best of their knowledge for a new
combined clinic for teenagers diagnosed with a rare genetic condition, Alstrom
Syndrome.
As they grow to adolescence, multiple organ systems can be affected, resulting
in blindness, hearing impairment, type two diabetes, heart failure, liver
disease, urological dysfunction, pulmonary fibrosis, and renal failure.
Kay Parkinson, who has two children with the syndrome, has campaigned for better
support for 20 years.
Now the charity has set up the first  clinic for the syndrome and patients from
across the country are expected to attend to access the best medical knowledge
of the condition.
This
means patients will get specialist care by experts and we can learn more about
the disease and how to prevent the onset of various problems."
Mrs Parkinson said many of the 29 patients in the country have been diagnosed
late in life because many doctors have never seen the condition before.
The
clinic, which will bring together experts in the syndrome, will offer them the
best possible care and advice.
Torbay Hospital is the only one in the South West
to receive government funding to provide a national service for a rare disease.
They will be met by doctors and other health professionals from the two national
centres of expertise, Birmingham and Torbay, and together they will review the
effects of the syndrome on the youngsters' health and lives.
Consultants from several different specialities are brought together in one
place and can compare notes about the wide-ranging complications being
experienced by patients.
This approach is being taken one step further for
younger patients with the inclusion of paediatric experts from the country's
only other Alstrom treatment centre.
In addition, Torbay Hospital's Alstrom clinic was hailed earlier this year at an
international conference in Copenhagen as the way forward for treating rare
disorders, rather than specialists working in isolation, and patients being seen
in multiple clinics.
Dr Richard Paisey spoke at the convention, run by the European Organisation for
Rare Diseases, to an audience of participants from 24 countries.
Dr Paisey,
consultant in diabetes and endocrinology at Torbay Hospital, said: "There's hope
that understanding this rare condition will throw more light on the very common
problems of type two diabetes and heart disease."

Washington: NIH scientists pursue new therapies to improve rare disease drug
development

LENGTH: 867  words

DATELINE: Washington


National Institute of Health, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

Four new pre-clinical drug development projects at the National Institutes of
Health will target a form of blindness and diseases characterized by cardiac
problems.
The projects were selected for their potential to treat specific rare
diseases and to help scientists uncover new information that can be shared with
other researchers.
The studies will be funded through the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected
Diseases (TRND) program at the NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational
Sciences (NCATS).
This group of projects also marks the TRND program's first use
of stem cells as well as its first collaboration with a large pharmaceutical
company, Eli Lilly, to co-develop a treatment for a rare disease.
Two projects employ therapeutic approaches to developing a treatment for
retinitis pigmentosa, a severe form of hereditary blindness.
A third project
focuses on a potential treatment for hypoparathyroidism, a hormone-deficiency
syndrome that can lead to cardiac problems and convulsions.
The remaining project aims to develop a possible therapeutic that targets a
cardiac disorder associated with LEOPARD syndrome, an extremely rare genetic
disease that affects many areas of the body.
About 80 percent of patients with
LEOPARD syndrome have a cardiac disorder called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder
to pump blood, which can lead to early death.
A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 Americans.
NIH estimates
that, in total, there are more than 6,000 rare diseases.
However, effective
pharmacologic treatments exist for only about 200 of these illnesses.
Private companies often do not pursue new therapies for rare diseases due to the
low anticipated return on investment.
Through TRND, NCATS advances potential
treatments for rare and neglected tropical diseases to first-in-human trials, an
approach known as "de-risking."
The new projects are:
Long-acting parathyroid hormone analog for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism

Henry U. Bryant, Ph.D., distinguished research fellow
Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis
Use of rapamycin for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in patients
with LEOPARD syndrome

Maria I. Kontaridis, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston
Use of retinal progenitor cells for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa

Henry J. Klassen, M.D., Ph.D., director, Stem Cell and Retinal Regeneration
Program
University of California, Irvine School of Medicine
Small molecule pharmacological chaperone for the treatment of retinitis
pigmentosa

William F. Brubaker, Ph.D., chief executive officer
Bikam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.
The collaborative project teams receive
in-kind support and gain access to TRND researchers with rare disease drug
development capabilities, expertise, and clinical and regulatory resources.
"We are particularly excited about this set of collaborative projects for its
potential to produce treatments for underserved patient populations," said John
C. McKew, Ph.D., acting director of NCATS Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation
and director of the TRND program.
A number of early projects fostered by TRND have reached the stage where
partners, such as pharmaceutical, biotechnology or disease groups, are being
sought to move the treatments out of TRND and in the next phases of clinical
development.
Through the program in the last two years, TRND researchers and
collaborators have advanced four projects to human clinical trials, evaluating
treatments for sickle cell disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hereditary
inclusion body myopathy and Niemann-Pick Type C.

TRND projects are applied for via a solicitation process, and NCATS currently is
accepting applications until September 30, 2013.

Alexion Joins Eurordis, NORD and Patient Organizations Worldwide in Celebrating
Rare Disease Day 2013

LENGTH: 1842  words


New Delhi, March 2 -- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALXN), joins the
European Organization for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS), the National Organization
for Rare Disorders (NORD) and patient organizations worldwide in celebrating
Rare Disease Day 2013, a global effort to focus attention on rare diseases,
their profound impact on patients, and the need for improved diagnosis and
treatment.
The theme of this year's celebration, "Rare Disorders without
Borders," aligns with Alexion's mission of developing and delivering
life-transforming therapies for patients worldwide who suffer from severe,
life-threatening diseases that are ultra-rare.
"On Rare Disease Day, we are breaking isolation and raising awareness.
We urge all stakeholders to reach across borders and
find common solutions to living with serious, chronic and life-threatening rare
diseases," said Yann Le Cam, Chief Executive Officer, EURORDIS.
"Working
together we can promote rare diseases as a public health priority, so to improve
patients' access to diagnosis and treatment."
Many rare and ultra-rare diseases are chronic, progressive and marked by
continuing pain, severe disability and high mortality rates.
Diagnosing and
managing these rare diseases is often made difficult by a lack of scientific
knowledge, research and medical innovation.
Few physicians are familiar with
diagnosing and treating these illnesses, which frequently leads to missed,
delayed or inaccurate diagnoses even when an approved, effective therapy is
available.1 Because of this, it is important to educate the medical community
through disease awareness programs and diagnostic initiatives to identify
patients suffering from rare and ultra-rare diseases as early as possible.
"Like many patients coping with a rare or ultra-rare disease, it took several
months for our daughter to get an accurate diagnosis," said Denise Schmidt,
mother of a young adult diagnosed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome
(aHUS), a chronic, ultra-rare and life-threatening disease that can
progressively damage vital organs.
"Increasing awareness among physicians and
patients is a vital first step to ensuring our loved ones receive the best
treatment and care."
Soliris is approved in the US, European Union, Japan and
other countries as the first and only treatment for patients with paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a debilitating, life-threatening and ultra-rare
blood disorder.
Soliris is also approved in the US and the European Union as the
first and only treatment for patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome
(aHUS), a debilitating and life-threatening ultra-rare genetic disorder.
"We understand that every day is Rare Disease Day for patients and families who
suffer from severe and life-threatening ultra-rare disorders and often live
without hope because an effective treatment option is not available," said
Leonard Bell, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alexion.
"The employees of
Alexion are committed to developing and delivering therapies that can transform
the lives of these patients.
We now serve patients in 50 countries by focusing
on disease education to help patients with PNH and aHUS receive an accurate
diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
At the same time, we continue to invest in
research and development with the goal of providing highly innovative therapies
to patients with additional severe and life-threatening disorders, which also
happen to be extremely rare."
Bringing Hope Across the Globe

Alexion is currently developing five highly innovative therapeutics, including
eculizumab (Soliris), which are being investigated in nine severe and
life-threatening ultra-rare disorders.
The company's development programs are
solely focused on:

* Severe disorders with devastating and life-threatening medical consequences

* Disorders with ineffective, or no treatment options

* Disorders that are ultra-rare and affect very small numbers of patients

About Rare and Ultra-Rare Disorders

In the United States, a disease is defined as rare if it affects fewer than 650
patients per million of population.2 The European Union definition of a rare
disease is one that affects fewer than five patients per 10,000 of population.3
In contrast, a disease is generally considered to be ultra-rare if it affects
fewer than 20 patients per million of population4 (one patient per 50,000) - and
most ultra-rare diseases affect far fewer people than this.
Despite the very small numbers of patients they affect, the impact of these rare
and ultra-rare diseases on patients, their families, and society is profound, as
many are severe, chronic and progressive, with high mortality rates.
Patients
with severe and life-threatening ultra-rare diseases often live without hope,
have no effective treatment options and may face premature death.
About aHUS

aHUS is a chronic, ultra-rare, and life-threatening disease in which a genetic
deficiency in one or more complement regulatory genes causes chronic
uncontrolled complement activation, resulting in complement-mediated thrombotic
microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels
throughout the body.5,6 Permanent, uncontrolled complement activation in aHUS
causes a life-long risk for TMA, which leads to sudden, catastrophic, and
life-threatening damage to the kidney, brain, heart, and other vital organs, and
premature death.5,7 Sixty-five percent of all patients with aHUS require kidney
dialysis, have permanent kidney damage or die within the first year after
diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI).8,9 The majority of
patients with aHUS who receive a kidney transplant commonly experience
subsequent systemic TMA, resulting in a 90% transplant failure rate in these TMA
patients.10

aHUS affects both children and adults.11 Complement-mediated TMA also causes
reduction in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and red blood cell destruction
(hemolysis).
While mutations have been identified in at least ten different
complement regulatory genes, mutations are not identified in 30-50% of patients
with a confirmed diagnosis of aHUS.11

About PNH

PNH is an ultra-rare blood disorder in which chronic, uncontrolled activation of
complement, a component of the normal immune system, results in hemolysis
(destruction of the patient's red blood cells).
PNH strikes people of all ages,
with an average age of onset in the early 30s.12 Approximately 10% of all
patients first develop symptoms at 21 years of age or younger.13 PNH develops
without warning and can occur in men and women of all races, backgrounds and
ages.
PNH often goes unrecognized, with delays in diagnosis ranging from one to
more than 10 years.14 In the period of time before Soliris was available, it had
been estimated that approximately one-third of patients with PNH did not survive
more than five years from the time of diagnosis.12 PNH has been identified more
commonly among patients with disorders of the bone marrow, including aplastic
anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).15-17 In patients with
thrombosis of unknown origin, PNH may be an underlying cause.12

About Soliris

Soliris is a first-in-class terminal complement inhibitor developed from the
laboratory through regulatory approval and commercialization by Alexion.
Soliris
is approved in the U.S., European Union, Japan and other countries as the first
and only treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH),
a debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening blood disorder, characterized by
complement-mediated hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells).
Soliris is also approved in the U.S. and the European Union as the first and
only treatment for patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a
debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by
complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA (blood clots in small
vessels).
Prospective clinical trials in additional patients are ongoing to
confirm the benefit of Soliris in patients with aHUS.
Soliris is not indicated
for the treatment of patients with Shiga toxin E. coli related hemolytic uremic
syndrome (STEC-HUS).
Alexion's breakthrough approach in complement inhibition has received the
pharmaceutical industry's highest honors: the 2008 Prix Galien USA Award for
Best Biotechnology Product with broad implications for future biomedical
research, and the 2009 Prix Galien France Award in the category of Drugs for
Rare Diseases.
Important Safety Information

The US product label for Soliris includes a boxed warning: "Life-threatening and
fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with Soliris.
Comply with the most current Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for meningococcal vaccination in
patients with complement deficiencies.
Immunize patients with a meningococcal
vaccine at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of Soliris,
unless the risks of delaying Soliris therapy outweigh the risk of developing a
meningococcal infection.
Monitor
patients for early signs of meningococcal infections and evaluate immediately if
infection is suspected.
In patients with PNH, the most frequently reported adverse events observed with
Soliris treatment in clinical studies were headache, nasopharyngitis (runny
nose), back pain and nausea.
Soliris treatment of patients with PNH should not
alter anticoagulant management because the effect of withdrawal of anticoagulant
therapy during Soliris treatment has not been established.
In patients with
aHUS, the most frequently reported adverse events observed with Soliris
treatment in clinical studies were hypertension, upper respiratory tract
infection, diarrhea, headache, anemia, vomiting, nausea, urinary tract
infection, and leukopenia.

 -----QUOTE----

SECTION: MAI; Pg.
After more than two years and being referred to different specialists, Marlee
was diagnosed with a rare disease called Rett syndrome.
Rett syndrome is a serious neurological disorder affecting only one in 9000
girls.
â[#x20ac]oeIt means itâ[#x20ac][TM]s Rett syndrome, not a hundred other
things,â[#x20ac] she said.
I think
you get lost on the way.â[#x20ac]

Feeling lost in a health system that better caters for more prevalent and
well-understood ailments is increasingly common among people with rare diseases
and their families, according to Professor Hugh Dawkins from the WA health
departmentâ[#x20ac][TM]s office of population health genomics.
About 190,000 West Australians, including 63,000 children, live with a rare
disease.
Parkinsonâ[#x20ac][TM]s disease, motor neurone disease,
Huntingtonâ[#x20ac][TM]s, haemophilia, muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis
are among more than 6000 known rare diseases.
A rare disease is life-threatening or chronically debilitating with a prevalence
of no more than one in 2000 people.
Like Marlee, people with rare diseases often
have multiple health problems and need care from different services.
Their
rareness makes diagnosis difficult, with some people waiting years and others
never getting a diagnosis.
â[#x20ac]oeIt was a 65-year journey, without a diagnosis, getting incorrect
treatment and being given different names for the disease,â[#x20ac] Professor
Dawkins said.
Last yearâ[#x20ac][TM]s Australian Rare Disease Survey, conducted by Professor
Dawkinsâ[#x20ac][TM] team, revealed 18 per cent of people with a rare disease
waited more than 10 years for a diagnosis.
WAâ[#x20ac][TM]s new rare diseases strategy â[#x20ac]" a first in the nation
â[#x20ac]" outlines measures to improve the lives of people with rare diseases
in the State by diagnosing more and sooner, so those people can be cared for
better and treated where possible.
Professor Dawkins said increasingly people
with rare diseases said they were invisible to the health system.
Under the three-year plan, the health department will look at creating rare
disease clinics in WA where GPs or specialists can refer people with a suspected
rare disease in a bid to get them diagnosis and treatment.
Your worst fear is that thereâ[#x20ac][TM]s
something you can do to fix it and no oneâ[#x20ac][TM]s picking it up.â[#x20ac]

Professor Dawkins said the problem could be solved in part by raising the
profile of rare diseases among GPs and specialists and giving them tools to help
with diagnosis.
Second, Professor Dawkins said, the WA health department could soon start using
the existing 2500 codes for different rare diseases to track them in the system
and the community.
In August, Australasiaâ[#x20ac][TM]s first â[#x20ac]oeundiagnosed diseases
programâ[#x20ac] workshop will be held in Perth where difficult, complex and
rare cases that have been baffling specialists will be discussed by experts from
Australia and the US.
Thatâ[#x20ac][TM]s the purpose of this workshop.â[#x20ac]

Mark Gummer, from support group HeartKids WA, said families with children who
have a rare disease could feel alone, isolated and secluded.
â[#x20ac]oeOnce the diagnosis is known to families, they can easily become
overwhelmed by things like the frequency of medical appointments, medical
terminology which they may not understand, and just the overall processes and
procedures involved with treatment.
â[#x20ac]oeThe complexity of specific health issues can often be inexplicable
and unresolvable.â[#x20ac]

Amanda Samanek, from support group Genetic and Rare Disease Network WA, said the
strategy was an important start to address major concerns of people with rare
diseases and their carers.
â[#x20ac]oeSimply because rare diseases are rare this can mean that there are
greater challenges for people throughout their lives from the difficulties many
people face in obtaining a timely diagnosis, to the burden of high-cost
medicines and high dependency on health, community and disability care,â[#x20ac]
she said.
Marlee Watson lives as best as she can with her rare disease, thanks to her
family, friends and doctors.
Ms Watson said Marleeâ[#x20ac][TM]s prognosis was uncertain, but the support,
particularly from the Telethon Kids Institute-based Australian Rett Syndrome
Study, that came with her diagnosis helped.

'Families waiting more than a year for genetic services'

SECTION: IRELAND

LENGTH: 327 words


A conference on rare diseases held in Dublin Castle yesterday heard that genetic
services are critically under-resourced.
Head of the Rare Disease Task Force, Philip Watt, said many of the
recommendations of the National Rare Disease Plan, launched in 2014, have not
been implemented.
It is estimated that the lives of more than 300,000 children and adults are
impacted by rare diseases and four out of five are thought to be genetic.
Chairwoman of the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation, Avril Daly, said
people with undiagnosed rare and genetic diseases are unable to benefit from new
treatments and therapies coming on-stream.
Rachel Martin, 35, from Limerick who has a rare connective tissue disorder,
called Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (LDS) was only genetically diagnosed with the
condition eight years ago.
Ms Martin, a patient advocate with the Marfan
Syndrome Support Group Ireland, had to give up her job as a residential property
manager because of ongoing health problems.
The conference marking International Rare Diseases Day was organised by the
Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation, the Medical Charities Research Group
and the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry.

Mother fears delay in rare disease plan

Anne Lawlor's daughter,  ine, 28, was born with a genetic deletion syndrome
called 22q11 deletion syndrome but was only diagnosed with the condition when
she was 15.
Ms Lawlor spoke at yesterday's European Conference on Rare Diseases that took
place at Farmleigh House in Dublin during which the first step towards the
development of a national plan for rare disease patients in Ireland was taken.
Deputy chief medical officer at the Department of Health, Dr John Devlin, who
also spoke at the conference, said the guidelines provided by the European
initiative had laid the groundwork for discussion on all the main issues
surrounding rare diseases.
The issues include centres of excellence, development of research on rare
diseases, access to therapies and treatments and patient empowerment.
About 12 babies are born every year in Ireland with the
condition, caused by a deletion of a piece of chromosome 22, which results in
heart problems, developmental delay and learning difficulties.
About 157,000 people in Ireland have rare diseases that are notoriously
difficult to diagnose.
The conference was organised by the Irish Platform for Patients' Organisations,
Science and Industry, the genetic Rare Disorders Organisation and the Medical
Research Charities and is part of a European initiative to develop a national
strategy for rare diseases.
A minute's silence was held at the conference to mark the passing on Wednesday
of Saoirse Heffernan, 5, from Keel, Co Kerry, who lost her battle with Batten's
disease, an inherited disease of the nervous system, on Wednesday.

Putting a name to Hannah Young's rare condition was only half the battle, writes
FRANCES THOMPSON.
Hannah,
her first born, had the rare genetic condition Williams Syndrome.
He saw
the telltale physical signs of the syndrome "as soon as we walked in the door,"
she said.
Hannah, now 20, is one of an estimated 1.2 million Australians who
have a rare disease or condition.
Monday is Rare Disease Day, a day that
Newcastle clinical geneticist Dr Tracy Dudding hopes will draw attention to the
need for a national plan to help people such as Hannah and her family and others
like them.
"A missed diagnosis of these rare diseases is quite common," Dudding
said.
"Many doctors may never have heard of them and parents and patients have
to become advocates for their condition.
Williams Syndrome,
which can affect one in 20,000 children, is caused by the absence of genetic
material on chromosome seven.
The condition
also causes facial characteristics, loose joints, and cardio vascular problems,
among other physical difficulties.
"The problem is having the
disability recognised as a permanent disability, like Down syndrome."

'National policy for rare diseases a welcome step, challenges ahead'

LENGTH: 738  words

DATELINE: New Delhi


New Delhi, June 10 -- Experts have welcomed the government's decision to approve
the National Policy for the Treatment of Rare Diseases, the draft of which was
submitted by the Union Ministry of Health to the Delhi High Court on 25 May.
However, they feel that the expensive and prohibitive nature of the treatment
with no insurance coverage, untimely diagnosis, and delay in implementation of
the policy are among few of the challenges that need to be addressed.
The policy
saw the light of day after multiple representations to the Central Government
and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare were made since 2009 by lawyers
and organisations working for the treatment of rare diseases.
A rare disease, comprising rare tumors and genetic diseases like Gaucher
Syndrome, Hunter Syndrome and Pompe, is a health condition which has low
prevalence and affects a small number of people.
Speaking to The Sunday
Guardian, experts noted that 50% of the afflicted are children-70% of whom die
aged between one and seven due to lack of effective treatment.
According to
reports, at least 7 crore Indians suffer from over 14,000 rare diseases
identified worldwide.
The policy recommends an initial corpus of Rs 100 crore for the treatment of
genetic disorders, but excludes rare blood disorders like Thalassemia and
sickle-cell anemia.
Delhi High court orders in three writ petitions in 2013 and 2016, advocated by
lawyer Ashok Aggarwal, had directed the Health Ministry to frame a national
policy for rare diseases.
The diagnosis of rare conditions takes up to several years, in certain cases
seven years.
"For many rare diseases, no diagnostic method
exists.
Lack of data on burden, morbidity and mortality of rare diseases
prevents the timely diagnosis and estimation of the treatment costs.
Most of the rare diseases
are not diagnosed at all, and in some of them, the child dies within 72 hours if
he is not treated," Dr Prasanna B. Shirol, founder and director, Organisation of
Rare Diseases India (ORDI), said.
The policy advocates developing materials for
generating awareness in the general public, patients and healthcare providers.
The government has asked the Department of Financial services to bring in the
insurance act and make the insurance sector cover the cost of treatment of rare
diseases.
Currently, no Indian insurance company is reimbursing the costs of the
treatment of these diseases, which ranges anywhere between Rs 30 lakh to Rs 3
crore.
Experts also feel that the process format suggested by the Health
Ministry may take up to two years or more, hence depriving timely treatment to
patients.
Twins Peter John and John Paul Parco, 19, and their younger brother Vicente
Isaac, 18, were like children, free from worries about Hunter Syndrome, a rare
birth defect that had stunted their development.
The three boys, along with 32 children suffering from rare disorders, were
treated to a fun-filled day, flying and sailing with the Philippine Navy as part
of the celebration of the 9th World Rare Disease Day on Feb. 29.
The daylong event, called Fly and Sail with Rare, was organized by the
Philippine Society for Orphan Disorders (PSOD), a nonprofit organization
supporting individuals with rare diseases, in partnership with the Philippine
Navy and groups like Photography with a Difference and Makati Camera Club.
Day without worries

John Chua, a commercial photographer and founder of Photography with a
Difference, said the project was aimed to give the patients a day without
worries.
At 5 a.m., the patients, together with their parents and guardians, hopped into
a bus for the ride to the Philippine Navy base at Sangley Point, a former US
Navy station.
For 10 minutes, the patients enjoyed bird's-eye views of CaNacao Bay, the body
of water off the northeastern tip of Cavite, and the skyline of Cavite City, the
provincial capital.
Raising awareness

After the flight, the patients cruised CaNacao Bay aboard a Navy gunboat.
Pamela Roman, mother of Julia, 15, who has Rett Syndrome, a genetic disorder
that afflicts girls, said there was a need to raise awareness of rare diseases.
Of the 100 million Filipinos, about 5,000 are afflicted with rare diseases, also
known as orphan diseases.
Roman said some people in the government overlooked people with rare disorders,
giving priority to those with command diseases.
She bewailed the lack of awareness of rare disorders in the Philippines, even
among doctors.
When Julia was confined at 5, I had to print brochures about Rett syndrome to
give away to the doctors and nurses so I didn't have to keep on saying what it
is, she said.
Rare Diseases Act

On Saturday, she brought Julia on a wheelchair to the Navy's base here to make
her enjoy the plane and boat rides with the other patients.
Magdaraog said the families of patients with rare diseases were pinning their
hopes on the proposed Rare Diseases Act that would expand the government's
universal health-care program to cover patients with rare disorders.
The measure would create an Office of Rare Diseases in the Department of Health,
encourage research and development, and provide for fiscal and regulatory
incentives for the manufacture and importation of treatments for rare disorders.

Genetic mutations that cause rare diseases in Arabs identified by UAE team

BYLINE: Shireena Al Nowais

ABU DHABI // UAE scientists have uncovered genetic mutations that are
responsible for rare diseases in Arab children.
The discovery will help with the early detection and treatment of some of the
world's most serious and rare diseases, doctors said.
Dr Mahmoud Taleb Al Ali, director of the Centre for Arab Genomic Studies (Cags),
which is affiliated to the Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award for Medical
Sciences, said that a joint research project between Cags and Latifa Hospital
revealed links between "12 hereditary rare diseases among Arab children and 16
new genetic mutations in 14 genes".
A study was conducted on 20 patients from the UAE, Jordan, Sudan and Yemen, and
the results published in medical journals.
"This boosts efforts in the early detection of rare genetic diseases and for
finding effective treatments.
One mutation is responsible for Rapson-Mendenhall syndrome - a severe insulin
resistance that can result in death as well as developmental complications.
Another gene discovered was one that "leads to Beckwith-Weidmann syndrome, a
disorder with asymmetrical overgrowth of the organs and increased risk of
cancer", said Dr Fatima Bastaki, consultant paediatrician and clinical
geneticist at Latifa Hospital.
Dr Abdul Rezzek Hamzeh, a senior scientific coordinator at Cags, said that there
were more than 8,000 rare genetic disorders worldwide caused by mutated genes.
"Previously, doctors used to diagnose patients mainly depending upon clinical
symptoms without getting down to the genetic causes of the diseases," he said.
This method of diagnosing, Dr Hamzeh said, made it difficult to apply preventive
measures, early detection and treatment.
Thanks to research and these discoveries, some diseases can now be detected and
prevented at their earliest stages.
"It used to be very frustrating for families with known hereditary diseases to
not know if their child will inherit the gene or not," he said.
Project is the leading non-profit organization
advocating for the roughly 30 million Americans and approximately 350 million
people worldwide who are affected by rare and genetic diseases and disorders.
In
the United States, a disease is considered rare if it affects fewer than 200,000
Americans per disease.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
there are nearly 7,000 such rare diseases and an estimated 95% do not have a
single approved drug treatment.
"I am honored to be able to use my gift of music to help raise awareness
for the prevalence of rare and genetic diseases that affect millions of people
worldwide."
"Millions of people suffer from rare diseases that are misrepresented or
misunderstood by the world at large," said Katrina Parker.
"I became aware of rare diseases when I was starring on a medical drama series
and one special episode dealt with childhood cancer," said Jason George.
"I had
no idea that all childhood cancers are considered rare diseases and I was
floored when a number of families whose lives had been rocked by childhood
cancer reached out to me on Facebook to thank me for being part of the episode.
I have young children of my own and the "what if it was my child" question
landed hard, and ever since I've tried to support awareness for rare diseases in
any way possible."
Gracie Van Brunt, a young girl battling a rare disease called Shwachman-Diamond
Syndrome, will take the stage and perform a special song of hope that she wrote,
which chronicles her journey as a rare disease patient.
Shwachman-Diamond
Syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that attacks the pancreas, making it
difficult to digest food.
The disease also attacks bone marrow, stunting growth.

Rett Syndrome Drug Could Propel Newron To Next Level In 2018

LENGTH: 1451  words


Newron Pharmaceuticals SPA will target its second drug approval in 2018 -
following on from the success of its partnered Parkinson's disease therapy
Xadago (safinamide) - but this time the company is focused on a pediatric rare
disease that could change its commercial prospects dramatically.
CEO Stefan Weber told Scrip that the company is leading research and development
of new treatments for Rett syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects young
girls, and expects to file its drug sarizotan in the US and Europe next year.
The drug is not a cure for Rett syndrome but it targets one of the most
damaging features of the disease, apnea (temporary cessation of breathing).
The company's CEO is confident the Phase III study will yield positive results
and he highlighted that after discussions with regulators, Newron has recently
added younger patients into the trial.
The Sarizotan Treatment of Apneas in Rett
Syndrome (STARS) study was expanded in May this year to include Rett syndrome
patients as young as six years of age; previously the trial only included
patients aged 13 and over.
Weber noted that "the
inclusion of the younger patients in the study, and assurance from the FDA that
we should get a label for the complete population, means there is huge promise
that this drug might not only improve the duration of apnea but also, to a
certain extent, slow down damage to the brain."
Weber hopes that earlier use of
sarizotan will help to prevent brain damage that is caused by restriction of
oxygen in patients with prolonged apnea.
During this six-month
study, patients will receive treatment with daily doses of 10mg and 20mg of
sarizotan or placebo.
Weber said that Rett syndrome is
the "perfect indication for a small- to medium-sized company to do
commercialization on its own."
The company plans to target sarizotan to around
20,000 to 30,000 Rett syndrome patients in the US and Europe combined.
PRV Potential

If sarizotan is approved in the US for Rett syndrome in all age groups, Newron
will be eligible for a priority review voucher as the product would be indicated
for a pediatric rare disease.
Weber noted Newron could use a voucher to speed up
regulatory proceedings for its other clinical-stage compound evenamide, which is
in Phase II development as an add-on treatment for patients with schizophrenia
that are resistant to prescribed therapies.
Approximately 10 rare pediatric disease vouchers have been granted so far by the
FDA, many of these are yet to be redeemed.
M&A Opportunity

An approved rare disease therapy in a vacant market and an unused PRV would be
likely to put the spotlight on Newron as a potential biotech takeover target in
2018.
Little Rivalry In Rett Syndrome

There are no approved treatments for Rett syndrome and Weber highlighted that
Newron is the first company to run a pivotal study in this disease; "no one else
has made it to this stage," he said.
If sarizotan is successfully approved by regulators the drug will enter a vacant
market with huge unmet need, despite the number of patients in this rare disease
setting being limited.
Almost all cases of Rett syndrome are caused by a mutation in the MECP2 gene,
which is found on the X chromosome (one of the sex chromosomes).
"Competition does exist in Rett syndrome but others are at much earlier stages
than we are," Newron's chief exec said.
There are few compounds in the clinic
targeting Rett syndrome, a condition that affects about one in 12,000 girls born
each year and is only rarely seen in males.
Meanwhile, Eloxx Pharmaceuticals Ltd. has an RNA product in Phase I, and there
are a number of companies with preclinical candidates being tested in Rett
syndrome.
Despite Neuren being the closest competitor to sarizotan, Weber noted that the
Australian company is focused on the motoneuron aspects of the disease, whereas
his company is targeting the respiratory issues seen in Rett syndrome.
"We are about two years ahead of Neuren in development but we look forward to
seeing if they can offer additional benefits to patients," Weber said.
All other
therapies in the pipeline for Rett syndrome are at least four to five years
behind sarizotan in development.
Still, none of the treatments currently in the clinic are aiming to cure Rett
syndrome.
Weber said gene therapy is the most likely option to be able to treat
the cause of this condition.
A gene therapy option for Rett syndrome is still
decades away from the market though.
"There is a lot research going on now in Rett syndrome and that is very good,"
Weber said.
"One of the positive effects of our work is that people start
talking about this rare disease."
Economic Burden Study To Back Pricing

Alongside clinical trials in Rett syndrome, Newron is conducting a burden of
disease study that includes more than 750 patients and 250 healthcare
professionals.
It will use these results to help measure the economic and social
burden of the disease - something that hasn't been done by a pharma company
before in this space.
Weber said Newron will use evidence from its burden of disease study to
negotiate a price for its drug post-approval.
We want to have objective evidence ready of what the value of our
treatment is," he said.

April 07--PRINCETON -- Following five spinal taps, a local woman is working to
raise awareness about a rare disease that others may be battling without knowing
it.
Devic's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that attacks the nervous system.
"I want to educate
people on devic's syndrome."
According to Smith, she is the first person in West Virginia to have the disease
since 1978.
The symptoms for the rare disease are headaches, nerve pain, and loss of vision,
neck and back pain, loss of the use of arms and or legs.
People with the disease
also experience problems with their bowels and bladder.
Smith said the disease has paralyzed her nine times.
Devic's syndrome can also eat the myelin sheaths off your nerves.

She was sent to a specialist in Sydney after a year of suffering and was
diagnosed with stiff person syndrome.
While Ms Judd has since found successful treatment, the rare disease is
incurable, and still causes her stiffness each morning.
Ms Judd now wants to use her experience to help others and start a support group
in Wagga for people suffering from rare diseases.
"I believe I'm the only person with stiff person syndrome in the area but it
would be nice to connect with other people who have a rare disease," Ms Judd
said.
"It's amazing how much the treatment has helped me but other people aren't so

Woman from Park Gate inspired to help people with rare diseases

LENGTH: 394  words


WHEN Eloise Appleby heard a woman give an honest description of life with a rare
disease, she was inspired to help others.
But when she saw a video of Darcey Kelly- on Facebook on Rare Diseases Day -
talking about living with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and the impact it had on her
life, Eloise wanted to help people with rare conditions to get the same support
she did for her cancer.
And seeing Darcey talk openly about her experience inspired Eloise to do a 100km
walk for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome which affects the connective tissue in the body.
Eloise has recently become the co-ordinator for a support group for people with
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome which in severe cases causes joints dislocating, organs
tearing, curvature of the spine and delayed healing of wounds.
She added: It's a terrible, life-limiting condition which results in a daily
struggle - and sadly often early death.
She will be organising support meetings for anyone affected by the condition,
speaking up for the Ehlers-Danlos community in the Solent area and raising cash.

* Sean Merrell has responded to an experimental enzyme treatment.
His brother,
Cody, hopes for treatment also.
Brothers Sean and Cody Merrell of Herculaneum will travel to Washington this
week to lobby for government approval of an enzyme treatment that could save
their lives.
A rare disease shared by Sean, 10, and Cody, 8, could kill them within a decade.
But the experimental drug treatment offers hope that their lives could return to
a semblance of normalcy.
The brothers were diagnosed in July 2002 with Hurler-Scheie syndrome, one of a
variety of disorders known as MPS-I.
Hurler-Scheie syndrome is a rare genetic
disorder that affects about one in every 115,000 births.
Those affected with the disorder rarely live beyond their mid-20s.
Two years ago, Sean began an experimental treatment protocol aimed at
controlling the symptoms and halting the progress of the disease.
Whereas Sean has shown improvement during the treatment,
Cody has grown progressively worse.
They want the Food and Drug Administration to approve the therapy so Cody can
take part in the treatment as well.
The Merrells were invited to take part in the hearing by the National MP S
Society and the National Association for Rare Disorders because of their unique
situation.
Although the FDA doesn't have to follow the committee's recommendations, the
hearing is "a major hurdle" toward getting the treatment approved, says Abbey
Meyers, president of the organization for rare disorders.
"It's an opportunity for the manufacturer to present their data" and "for the
patients to stand up and say what they want," Meyers said.
"It's important for
the advisory committee to hear what the patients want and what their experience
has been."

Malmesbury resident with rare disease says research funding must increase to
ensure people are correctly diagnosed

A RESIDENT in Malmesbury is hoping to raise awareness of her rare and
debilitating disease.
Dr Lisa Tweedie, 49, was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) at the age
of 40, a disease which causes problems with collagen and therefore affects all
parts of the body.
It includes a complex group of rare disorders caused by changes in genes that
weaken the connective tissues.
"It's a condition which there really isn't enough public information about," she
said.
Lisa says this is a particular issue for women, as having the disease can bring
about complications during childbirth.
"It's really dangerous to have a pregnancy and not realise you have the
disease," she said.
Lisa wrote to her local MP, James Gray, urging him to speak out about the
disease.
He responded saying he welcomed the government's Strategy for Rare Diseases,
which he says commits to ensuring people living with a rare disease have access
to "the best evidence-based care and treatment".
The department's statement said: "The complexity of the syndrome and the
difficulty in diagnosing the milder forms of the condition means that an
accurate estimate of the number of affected individuals is difficult.
"The government is committed to improving the lives of patients and their
families affected by rare diseases including EDS.
"The UK continues to be at the forefront of research into rare diseases and
100,000 Genomes Project is actively accelerating progress in the understanding
of the genetic basis of rare diseases.
"The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) has significantly invested in
rare diseases research and funds a variety of initiatives to support the
development of new therapies."
On a bad day, a rare, chronic condition affecting her
calcium levels means that she can barely walk.
It affects about 50,000 people
in Europe and doctors treat it crudely by feeding patients up to 15 calcium
tablets a day - which, in the words of one sufferer, makes your gut feel "like a
cement mixer".
It is awaiting approval from the US
Food and Drug Administration and is keenly awaited by patients.
Shire's purchase of NPS taps into an increasingly popular field for the pharma
industry - rare diseases, or ailments that affect fewer than five out of every
10,000 people.
Invest-ment has soared: Deutsche Bank has estimated that the
category is worth $24 billion in sales, with rare disease medicines set to
double to 8 per cent of all global drugs sales by 2020.
According to Alastair Kent, the chairman of Rare Disease UK, a patients' support
group: "Large sections of the pharma industry used to take the view that rare
was synonymous with 'not very many affected' and was therefore not very
important.
The FDA approved 33 new medicines for rare diseases in 2013.
Shire alone has
drugs for Hunter syndrome, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease and hereditary
angioedema, all rare genetic ailments.
Sanofi, the French multinational, is
tackling Pompe disease, which causes progressive muscle weakness in babies,
while GLAXOSMITHKLINE is pumping funds into treating Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,
an immune deficiency suffered by barely four in a million people.
Chris Stirling, the head of life sciences at KPMG, says: "The whole direction of
this industry is personalised medicine - that means moving towards smaller
cohorts of patients."
Drugs for rare diseases are hugely expensive, however.
Shire charges more than
£100,000 per patient, per year for its treatments, arguing that to recoup the
cost of research in a small population, prices must be high.
A recent
study by MEDACorp, an American consultancy, found that 94 per cent of US health
insurers were "concerned" about the high price of drugs for unusual diseases.

Rare disease brings strain to Lexington family

BYLINE: Mat Batts, The Dispatch, Lexington, N.C.
But in Cooper's case, a rare condition known as
Kostmann's syndrome has marred the past few months of his life.
Known medically as congenital neutropenia and named after one of the first
doctors to study its effects, Kostmann's syndrome refers to an insufficiency of
bone marrow and the white blood cells known as neutrophils, which serve as an
essential part of the immune system.
But in the treatment of the
cyst, doctors noticed Cooper's depleted white blood cell count and knew
immediately something more serious was at work.
A disease doctors have told the Rolphs is one-in-a-million rare has the parents
struggling for answers and a way to pay for medical costs.
The Rolphs have set up a GoFundMe account to raise money for initial testing
Cooper will need to undergo before doctors can determine a method of treatment.
The family has also begun selling rare disease ribbons in partnership with
Global Genes, a patient advocacy group that raises awareness for rare diseases
through the symbol of hope.
Cooper is extremely
limited in his contact with other children and can't attend day care or school
until his condition is treated.
The family's ultimate goal is one day Cooper might be able to experience the
normal joys of childhood, but they admit a lot of questions remain regarding his
treatment.
Scott and Jennifer Rolph say if the fundraising is successful, money not used by
the family for testing and treatment of Cooper's illness will be donated to
Brenner Children's Hospital and Global Genes.

Spotlight on rare disease

LENGTH: 592  words


As February 29 is observed as 'Rare Disease Day' across the globe, let's know
about one barely known heart disease 'Tetralogy of Fallot', which has so far
affected almost 5,40,000 people in India.
We often read about health problems which are widespread and are affecting a
large number of people, but we hardly get any information on diseases which are
rare and not so known.
One such critical ailment in the category of 'Rare
Diseases in India' is Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).
Dr. Ashish Katewa, Consultant Paediatric Cardiac Surgery, Fortis Escorts Heart
Institute, Delhi highlights, "It's the commonest congenital cyanotic heart
disease in children.
Dr HK Chopra highlights the
conditions and factors during pregnancy that increase the risk of TOF in their
infants such as:

German measles (rubella) and some other viral illnesses.
Late pregnancy increases risk of this disease in baby (being older than 40).
Children with genetic
disorders, such as Down syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome, often have congenital
heart defects, including TOF.
Treatment

Navaneetham from Rare Disease India says, "It's a very complicated disease but
in many cases surgical interventions largely fixes the condition."
Dr Katewa
also adds, "Most of the children with the disease do not survive without
surgery.
The cost of the treatment varies upon the extent of open heart
surgery required.
So let's be fare to people suffering from rare diseases and help spread
awareness to support them.
Shocking

Experts estimate suggests that in India there are about 6000 to 8000 rare
diseases and over 3.3 crore patients are suffering from it.
Most of the rare
diseases are genetic in nature and unfortunately majority of them don't have any
cure.

Malmesbury resident urges government to improve funding for research into rare
diseases

BYLINE: Callum Chaplin

LENGTH: 472 words


A RESIDENT in Malmesbury is hoping to raise awareness of her rare and
debilitating disease.
Dr Lisa Tweedie, 49, was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) at the age
of 40, a disease which causes problems with collagen and therefore affects all
parts of the body.
It includes a complex group of rare disorders caused by changes in genes that
weaken the connective tissues.
"It's a condition which there really isn't enough public information about," she
said.
Lisa says this is a particular issue for women, as having the disease can bring
about complications during childbirth.
"It's really dangerous to have a pregnancy and not realise you have the
disease," she said.
Lisa wrote to her local MP, James Gray, urging him to speak out about the
disease.
He responded saying he welcomed the government's Strategy for Rare Diseases,
which he says commits to ensuring people living with a rare disease have access
to "the best evidence-based care and treatment".
The department's statement said: "The complexity of the syndrome and the
difficulty in diagnosing the milder forms of the condition means that an
accurate estimate of the number of affected individuals is difficult.
"The government is committed to improving the lives of patients and their
families affected by rare diseases including EDS.
"The UK continues to be at the forefront of research into rare diseases and
100,000 Genomes Project is actively accelerating progress in the understanding
of the genetic basis of rare diseases.
"The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) has significantly invested in
rare diseases research and funds a variety of initiatives to support the
development of new therapies."

Alberta will fund girl's treatment

DATELINE: EDMONTON


St. Albert father Dane Sadownyk picked up his three-year-old daughter Aleena and
"just hugged her" Monday morning when the family learned the Alberta government
will fund a crucial treatment for her rare medical condition.
Aleena's family and their supporters have been lobbying Alberta Health for a
month to approve treatment for Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome, a rare disease that
means she lacks glycosaminoglycan, an enzyme that helps break down cellular
waste.
Without treatment,
sufferers see their life expectancy cut short.
Four other provinces have agreed to
fund the treatment for seven children with the syndrome - also known as
mucopolysaccharidosis type VI or MPS VI - and Aleena's family was pushing
Alberta to quickly approve the expensive but critical treatment, which is
expected to initially cost about $300,000 a year.
Andrew McFayden, director of the Isaac Foundation, went through a similar
struggle in Ontario when his son Isaac was diagnosed with MPS VI as a toddler
and was the first to receive treatment in Canada.
But McFayden also said the happiness is mixed with frustration that it took so
long and that the family's supporters felt they had to mount a public campaign
with the support of MLAs such as Wildrose health critic Heather Forsyth after
the family's original funding application through the Alberta Rare Disease
Program was denied.
"To me, that's a big
problem there still hasn't been a process put in place by Health Canada for
provinces to deal with funding these rare diseases."
Health Minister Fred Horne
said Monday he signed off on the funding for Aleena's treatment through
Alberta's Short Term Evaluative Drug Therapy program, instead of the Rare
Disease program, because Aleena's case involves a drug not licensed for sale in
Canada.
Horne said he weighed several factors, including the clinical evidence, the
rarity of the disease, affordability of the drug and the best interest of the
patient.
But
these kinds of situations are becoming more common in Canada and it's because we
have more drugs coming out every day and more and more of these drugs are geared
to rare diseases."
Horne said he plans to talk about the need for an orphan drug program - a term
used to describe medications for rare diseases - with other provincial health
ministers and federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose.
Forsyth, MLA for Calgary-Fish Creek, said Alberta Health must work to make the
provincial system easier to navigate for families who suddenly find themselves
seeking help with a rare condition.
"The whole thing is just convoluted," said Forsyth, who said she was overwhelmed
to hear Aleena will receive treatment.

Victoria's journey: Funds established to help woman with rare disease

Feb. 18--Victoria Humphries, or Vicki as she's known to family and friends,
became a caregiver when she returned to Corsicana to help her parents when both
were struck with very serious medical issues in 2013.
Now, Vicki is the one in Baylor Hospital with a very serious illness -- an
illness so rare, she's the first patient there with exactly that disease.
Vicki was found to have Castleman-Kojima Disease (TAFRO Syndrome).
The
hematologist said a person can have Castleman's disease without TAFRO syndrome,
but a person cannot have TAFRO syndrome without Castleman's disease.
That doctor
said while Vicki is not the first patient they have seen with Castleman's
disease, she is the first patient at Baylor with TAFRO Syndrome.
The disease affects the lymphatic system, and is currently affecting her heart.
"This disease has no cure, but the hope is
that this drug helps to get her body functions back in sync."
There has been a GoFundMe account set up in Vicki's name, and an account at
Community National Bank and Trust in the name of Cindy Humphries to benefit
Victoria Humphries, if you feel so led to help this young lady in what may be a
very lengthy fight against a rare disease with heft medical bills.

Acer Therapeutics Closes $8.15 Million Series B Financing

LENGTH: 751  words


May 10 -- Acer Therapeutics Inc., a pharmaceutical company developing therapies
for serious rare diseases with significant unmet medical need, today announced
the company has closed its Series B round with $8.15 million in new investment.
Proceeds from the financing will primarily be used to prepare a new drug
application (NDA) for the company's lead candidate, ACER-002 (celiprolol
hydrochloride), which is being developed for the treatment of vascular
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS), a rare, life-threatening genetic connective
tissue disorder.
Acer also plans to use the funds to support manufacturing and
clinical development of ACER-001, a proprietary taste-masked, immediate-release
formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPBA) for Maple Syrup Urine Disease
(MSUD) and Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD), serious genetic diseases which impact
amino acid and ammonia metabolism, respectively.
"This latest investment is
representative of our commitment to the team and to the patients suffering from
these disorders," adds Dr. Marengere.
"With this latest financing, Acer is well-positioned to progress our late-stage
therapeutic candidates for serious rare diseases, particularly as we rapidly
advance our lead candidate ACER-002 for vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome toward
key regulatory milestones," said Chris Schelling, CEO and founder of Acer.
Both ACER-002 and ACER-001 received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), which is provided to drugs and biologics that are
defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or
prevention of rare diseases and disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people
in the U.S.

About ACER-002 and Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS)

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of hereditary disorders of connective
tissue.
Vascular EDS (vEDS) is the most severe subtype where patients suffer
from life threatening arterial dissections and ruptures, as well as intestinal
and uterine ruptures.
There are
approximately 2,000 people in the U.S. diagnosed with vEDS, though experts
estimate as many as 5,000 patients may be affected.
There are currently no
FDA-approved therapies for vEDS.1

Acer is advancing ACER-002 (celiprolol), a new chemical entity (NCE), for the
treatment of vEDS and plans to file an NDA based on a randomized controlled
clinical study of celiprolol.2 In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) granted ACER-002 orphan drug designation for the potential treatment of
vEDS.
About ACER-001

Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is a rare, devastating genetic disease which
prevents the proper metabolism of three essential amino acids - leucine,
isoleucine and valine.
There is no FDA-approved therapy for MSUD, and the
condition is sub-optimally managed by a highly-restricted diet alone.
Despite
this diet, patients experience poor neurological outcomes and social impairment.
Approximately 2,000 patients have been diagnosed with a UCD in the U.S.

Acer is planning to initiate pivotal clinical studies of ACER-001 for the
treatment of MSUD and UCD.
In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
granted ACER-001 orphan drug designation for the potential treatment of MSUD.

As a sufferer of the rare genetic condition, Ehlers Danlos syndrome, 25-year-old
Rhiannen Sugars battles with hyper mobile joints resulting in constant
subluxations and dislocations, cervical spine instability and constant pain and
discomfort.
Despite being born with the disease, Ms Sugars was only diagnosed a couple of
years ago after her friend, a medical student, encouraged her to look into
Ehlers Danlos syndrome.
Ehlers Danlos syndrome is one of 8000 known rare diseases that affect about two
million Australians.World Rare Disease Day, held on February 28, aims to raise
awareness of these diseases and their impact on patients lives.

Man runs for rare disease cure

Noah Coughlan is the type of guy who enjoys going for&nbsp; a daily jog.
He's a
bit more ambitious than most, though - his runs don't take him around the block,
but across the country.In February, Coughlan set out from New York City on his
third cross-America run to raise money for rare disease awareness.Well-known
diseases often have marathons and walks organized in their names that draw
thousands of participants each year.
The nearly 7,000 rare diseases tend to draw
less attention, but to the 30 million Americans who have them, the effects are
no less devastating.Coughlan's motivation for his first run in 2011 was two
girls he knew growing up in California who had Batten disease, a rare and fatal
genetic disorder.
He set out to raise awareness for Batten disease, but as the
journey progressed he realized rare diseases covered a much broader spectrum.
"We
don't talk about (rare diseases) a lot, but they're right under the surface,"
Coughlan said.
Leach,
who has complex regional pain syndrome, started a support group after his
diagnosis several years ago and has been a strong proponent of CRPS and rare
disease awareness.When he heard of Coughlan's Run 4 Rare, Leach knew he wanted
to help Coughlan do the most possible good with his time in Oklahoma City.
"Noah
has been doing a great job raising awareness and getting attention to rare
diseases,"&nbsp; Leach said.
"It's not every day you meet a guy who's running
across the U.S."Weather, road conditions, and other unpredictable factors meant
Coughlan didn't know where he'd be in his route until a few days before he
arrived.
Other rare disease advocates, including Leach, were present to
discuss legislation regarding how doctors are trained to handle rare diseases
and answer questions from the public about the diseases.Making it personalAlong
his run, Coughlan has met many people affected by rare diseases.
He's made it
part of his mission to dedicate each day of his run to a different person or
disease, and the website that tracks his progress has links to organizations
that fund rare disease research.One of the people to have a run day dedicated to
him was Mark Dvorak of Norman.
Dvorak, who has hereditary spastic paraplegia,
said one of the key benefits he hopes will come from Coughlan's awareness
campaign is earlier detection of diseases.
It's very sad, and it's bad enough for
adults, but the majority of rare diseases affect children, and that's even
sadder.
All three of his runs are the subject of a
documentary produced by Luminous Pictures, a California-based independent film
company, slated for release in 2016.He said he hopes more people will be
inspired to learn about rare diseases on their own, empathize with those
affected, and contribute to research efforts for prevention and cures.
Ultimately, he'd like to see the diseases become not just rare but extinct.To
learn moreFor more information on Coughlan's journey and how to support it, go

syndrome support group, see the&nbsp; CRPS UNITED page on Facebook or email

Helping children with rare disorders;
Society raises funds and holds awareness campaigns to support families with
afflicted kids

BYLINE: Priscilla Kham

For two months, Ms Patricia Ng and her husband did not know what was wrong with
their six-month-old daughter, Chloe, who was having difficulty swallowing her
milk.
Doctors thought she might have a heart condition, Down syndrome, or a thyroid
problem.
But an examination by a geneticist and a blood test analysed in the United
States confirmed she was suffering from Pompe disease, an inherited
neuromuscular disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness.
Infants with Pompe disease normally do not survive past their first year, and
need enzyme replacement therapy before the age of six months to improve their
chances of survival.
After their ordeal, Ms Ng and her husband started the Rare Disorders Society
Singapore (RDSS) for families of children with such disorders.
The support group raises funds for
hospitals and has held several rare disorders awareness campaigns.
It met yesterday to commemorate international Rare Disease Day.
Jointly
organised with Club Rainbow, the event aimed to raise awareness of rare diseases
that afflict children, in order to facilitate early detection.
The United States National Institutes of Health says a disease is rare if fewer
than 200,000 people in the US, a country of 315 million, have it.
There are about 6,000 to 8,000 known rare diseases worldwide, but the number
here is not known.
Three-quarters of them affect children, according to the
European Society for Paediatric Oncology, and 30 per cent of patients die before
the age of five.
Because of their nature, rare disorders are difficult to diagnose.
Mrs Yeo Biyi, a 38-year-old financial consultant whose six-year-old daughter
Robby was diagnosed with Williams syndrome when she was 10 months old, was
thankful she got treatment early.
Williams syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects learning ability, and
has symptoms such as low muscle tone, affecting mobility.
"We got her started on treatments like physiotherapy immediately, and we felt
that starting early greatly improved her ability to walk," said Mrs Yeo.
"Though rare diseases may affect only a few people, we need to start with the
premise that every Singaporean matters," said its president, Mr Gregory
Vijayendran.
"Although they are rare, there is enough common ground with other
more common diseases when it comes to emotional journeys that parents and
children go through."

HEALTH;
On Rare Diseases, Parents Take Hope Into Their Own Hands

BYLINE:  By DAVID TULLER

SECTION: Section F; Column 5; Giving; Pg.
There was no effective treatment for the disease, which causes premature aging
and usually results in early-adolescent death from cardiovascular complications.
And the condition was so rare, affecting fewer
than one child in four million, that no group was working to improve the
prospects for those afflicted.
Since its founding in 1999, Dr.
Gordon said, it has created, for research, a tissue bank of children who have
progeria; awarded $1.2 million in grants to study the disease; organized the
first symposium ever dedicated to the issue; and served as an information and
networking resource for other families coping with the ailment.
We were told, 'Well, it's a rare
disease, there's no funding for it, no one knows about it.'
But those suffering from rare disorders have usually suffered in
isolation.
In recent years,
hundreds, if not thousands, of groups have taken advantage of online offers of
services and solace to patients with rare diseases, as well as to their families
and friends.
Although some organizations remain small and focus only on
providing emotional support and treatment information, others devote time to
searching for answers to complex medical and scientific questions.
"These organizations usually start when a number of families get together and
begin a support group," said Abbey Meyers, the founder and president of the
National Organization for Rare Disorders, an umbrella group in Danbury, Conn.
"But eventually somebody says, 'I want to find treatment or a cure,' and in
order to accomplish that, you have to raise money.
Earlier this year, for example, researchers affiliated with the progeria
foundation announced that they had identified the gene that causes the syndrome,
a discovery that should spur efforts to find treatments and possibly a cure.
At an October gathering organized partly by the Interstitial Cystitis
Association, scientists studying this extremely painful bladder condition
announced that they had identified the structure of a unique protein found in
the urine of people who suffer from it, said Dr. Vicki Ratner, an orthopedic
surgeon and the group's founder and president.
As typical of rare disease groups, Dr. Ratner's organization provides
researchers with small grants -- for the cystitis association, that means
$10,000 to $15,000 -- to set up pilot projects.
"It wasn't as if someone said, 'There's this terrible disease,
how can we help you?'
"

The National Institutes of Health, which defines a rare illness as one with
fewer than 200,000 sufferers, estimates that there are 6,000 such ailments,
which combined afflict 25 million people in the United States.
With names like
alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, late infantile Batten disease and
neurofibromatosis, many conditions remain virtually unknown to the general
public.
"People donate to the charities that represent the diseases they fear they are
going to get -- lung disease, heart disease, cancer," said Ms. Meyers of the
National Organization for Rare Disorders.
"But these diseases are totally
unfamiliar.
Like private donors, government agencies have traditionally dedicated most of
their money to brand-name illnesses with large advocacy groups, so part of the
role of the rare disease foundations is to pique the interest of elected
officials and scientists.
This month, the institute announced the start
of a network of rare disease research centers that will receive more than $50
million over the next five years.
A staunch advocate of the initiative in rare disease research is Dr. Stephen C.
Groft, the director of the N.I.H.
's Office of Rare Diseases.
Dr. Groft's office
has worked closely with many patient and family groups to help sponsor
scientific symposiums on diseases and to find other ways of fostering research.
It is also putting together regional meetings to teach representatives of rare
disease groups how the N.I.H.
"The groups are really our research partners, the link between patients and the
research community," he said.
Although the disease affects only one in about
6,000 children, the organization raised $4.5 million last year and has committed
more than $10 million in research grants through 2005, said Ms. Wimsatt, whose
son suffers from the disorder.
Few rare diseases can claim a celebrity spokesman, the way Michael J.
Fox
represents Parkinson's disease.
In a recent article in the Journal of Medical Biography, some doctors speculated
that Franklin D. Roosevelt suffered not from polio but from Guillain-Barre
syndrome, a neurological disorder that leads to paralysis.
While its cause
remains unknown, most people recover from the syndrome, though some suffer
long-term disabilities.
Whether the theory about Roosevelt is true or not, it got the disease's name in
the headlines, which surprised and delighted Estelle L. Benson, a former
schoolteacher and the executive director of the Guillain-Barre Syndrome
Foundation International, in Wynnewood, Pa.

Rare disease can involve cardiac complications

BYLINE: Dr. Keith Roach, The Windsor Star

SECTION: ARTS & LIFE; Dr. Keith Roach; Pg.
He has a history of heart disease in his family, and we
went to the emergency room.
One of the first things the doctor asked was, "Do
you have Marfan's syndrome?"
We'd never heard of Mar-fan's syndrome, so we said
"no."
When the cardiologist examined my husband, again one of the first things
mentioned was Marfan's syndrome.
My question is, Why wouldn't any of the doctors in 50 years of regular visits
know about or mention the possibility of his having this syndrome?
- A.

Marfan's syndrome is a rare disease of collagen - a protein that provides most
of the structure for the soft tissues in our body.
People with Marfan's syndrome tend to be tall and thin, with disproportionately
long arms and fingers.
As a tall, skinny person, I was asked
repeatedly if I had Mar-fan's syndrome - which I don't.
It used to be said that the life expectancy of Marfan's patients was 35 years,
but with the realization that some people have a more benign presentation, along
with advances in medical treatment, the life expectancy is much improved.
The prednisone prescribed for
this condition has given me my life back.
Polymyalgia rheumatica is an uncommon, but by no means rare, condition, usually
affecting people older than 50.
It has nothing whatsoever to do with rheumatic fever, which, fortunately, really
IS rare now, except for the word "rheumatic," which just refers to "joints,"
since both conditions cause joint symptoms.
Polymyalgia rheumatica often is not diagnosed in a timely fashion, as symptoms
can begin slowly, and both patients and doctors can think it is just ordinary
joint pain or early arthritis.

Their diseases are rare, but their suffering isn't; Patients push for more

They call themselves the Regroupement québécois des maladies orphelines (the
association of orphan diseases.)
They are 17 groups representing Quebecers with
illnesses and conditions that most people have never heard of, with names like
achondroplasia, Angelman and DiGeorge syndromes, Morquio's disease, lactic
acidosis and Prader-Willi syndromes.They are all rare diseases, most of them
congenital or appearing suddenly in childhood.
A rare disease is officially defined as a life-threatening or chronically
debilitating disease or condition with a low prevalence and a high level of
complexity.
To be classified as "rare" fewer than one in 2,000 people will have
been affected by it.
Some 7,000 such diseases have been officially recognized
around the world and in Quebec as many as 500,000 people are believed to suffer
from one of them.
Everyone in the room had somehow been touched by a rare disease and now they had
come together to seek solace in each other's stories and to lobby for more
information, mutual support and better access to treatment and support services.
"And because the illnesses are so rare, there are
often delays in getting diagnosis and treatment.
At yesterday's meeting, Laure Waridel brought the room to tears when she spoke
of the everyday joys and hardships of caring for her 5-year-old daughter Alphée,
who has Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, a metabolic and developmental disorder that
affects many parts of the body.
" became our
obsession," recalled Waridel, who still hasn't met anyone else with the syndrome
.
Barry Katsof, who has PNH (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria), whose main
complication is a high risk of kidney and liver failure and blood clots forming
in the blood vessels, said Canada is decades behind the rest of the world in
recognizing rare diseases and creating a national policy guiding how they are
tracked and treated.

CM asked to show urgency in treatment of LSD patients

Lysosomal Storage Disorders Support Society (LSDSS) has appealed to chief
minister Vasudhara Raje to show urgency in the treatment of patients with this
rare disease.
Five children with the disease have already died in the recent
past.
LSDSS has submitted a letter of appeal with patients\x92 medical certificates
and other relevant documents to government officials including health minister
Rajendra Rathore urging them to take a step for providing treatment to children
suffering from lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs).
Majority of children with LSD are unable to get treatment as its yearly cost is
estimated to be Rs 1 crore.
A patient requires treatment throughout life.
\x93My son is suffering from Hunter syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS
II).
When he was just four-years-old, he was diagnosed with the disease.
Since
the treatment is quite expensive, which is almost Rs 1 crore per year, I am
unable to start his treatment.
He is surviving without treatment,\x94 the
boy\x92s father said.
Since the cost of treatment is quite high, the father
is unable to provide the required treatment for his son.
The LSDSS has pointed out that the families of the rare patients are going
through a tough time for the past three years (5 children have died already), as
they cannot afford the life-saving treatment

for their children due to its high cost.
The families are hopeful that the
government will take necessary steps immediately to provide access to
life-saving treatment.
\x93Fourteen months ago, at the round table, health minister Rajendra Singh
Rathore had announced to set up a committee for LSD patients.
He had also said
that a nodal officer would be deputed to undertake a number of welfare
initiatives including making treatment available under National Health Mission
and drugs available under the free medicine scheme for the patients.
It has been
14 months now and these patients are still waiting to hear from the government
on implementing the initiatives,\x94 LSDSS mentioned in the letter to the CM.
On February 25, families of rare disease patients had met key genetic experts
and health ministry officials to discuss their plight and access to treatment on
Stakeholders\x92 Round Table Meeting (RTM) for welfare of rare disease patients
in Rajasthan.
A rare disease is a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition that
affects a very small number of people.
'Over 7,000 rare diseases exist'

According to a book -Rare diseases in paediatrics, written by Dr Ashok Gupta, JK
Lon superintendent, "It is estimated that more than 7,000 distinct rare diseases
exist today, affecting patients in their physical capabilities, mental
abilities, behaviour and sensorial capacities."
The names of some of rare diseases are Gaucher Type I, Fabry's disease, Pompe
disease, MPS-I (Hurler disease), MPS-II (Hunter disease), MPS-VI (Maroteaux-Lamy
syndrome).

A woman whose immune system is attacking her body's cells - one of only about 30
people in Ontario with the condition.
A mother who took her children to the
United States so they could regain some mobility lost due to their rare
connective tissue disorder.
A man whose rare condition went undiagnosed for 32
years until he took research into his own hands.
Those three people came to the Ontario legislature Monday as representatives of
the recent wave of rare-disease sufferers who had pleaded with the government
for help, and who are now looking for a comprehensive strategy.
Michael Harris, Progressive Conservative MPP for Kitchener-Conestoga, said a new
group of people with rare diseases could easily show up at the legislature every
week, or maybe even every day.
Jennifer Hamilton is one of about 30 people in Ontario with atypical hemolytic
uremic syndrome, or aHUS, a life-threatening condition in which the immune
system attacks the body's cells, damaging blood vessels.
He applauded Harris for his advocacy on behalf of rare-disease sufferers, but
wouldn't say yet if the Liberal government will support the motion.
Chantelle Willson, a nurse and mother of four from Brantford, said her husband
and two of her children have been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a
hereditary connective-tissue disorder.
Ian Stedman has Muckle-Wells Syndrome, characterized by full-body rashes, fevers
and joint pain, and said he had made 176 visits to the doctor before he was 18.
He didn't get a proper diagnosis until the age of 32, when he noticed his
daughter experiencing similar symptoms and started researching conditions on his
own, he said.
Stedman said he and his three-year-old daughter are some of the lucky
rare-disease sufferers because there is treatment available for them, but he
hopes Harris's proposed committee could find a way to help more people get
proper diagnoses.

Kian Jordan Rose pulls himself up, glances at "Barney" and gingerly walks to a
stack of books.
Kian Rose has Hurler's Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that debilitates vital
organs and often causes retardation.
Most patients die of heart failure between 5 and 10.
They know Hurler's Syndrome sufferers in their late
teens "and even 20," Sharon said.
He rarely complains about anything."
Finally, after three weeks of intense scrutiny, doctors diagnosed the disease,
first described in 1919 by German doctor Gertrud Hurler.
The successful bone marrow transplant Kian had when he was 2 slowed the disease,
but it's incurable, his mother said.
"We consider it a treatment," she said of the transplant.
Kian's disease is more devastating for dad than mom, Sharon said.

A woman whose immune system is attacking her body's cells - one of only about 30
people in Ontario with the condition.
A mother who took her children to the
United States so they could regain some mobility lost due to their rare
connective tissue disorder.
A man whose rare condition went undiagnosed for 32
years until he took research into his own hands.
Those three people came to the Ontario legislature Monday as representatives of
the recent wave of rare-disease sufferers who had pleaded with the government
for help, and who are now looking for a comprehensive strategy.
Michael Harris, Progressive Conservative MPP for Kitchener-Conestoga, said a new
group of people with rare diseases could easily show up at the legislature every

Jennifer Hamilton is one of about 30 people in Ontario with atypical hemolytic
uremic syndrome, or aHUS, a life-threatening condition in which the immune
system attacks the body's cells, damaging blood vessels.
He applauded Harris for his advocacy on behalf of rare-disease sufferers, but
wouldn't say yet if the Liberal government will support the motion.
Chantelle Willson, a nurse and mother of four from Brantford, said her husband
and two of her children have been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a
hereditary connective-tissue disorder.
Ian Stedman has Muckle-Wells Syndrome, characterized by full-body rashes, fevers
and joint pain, and said he had made 176 visits to the doctor before he was 18.
He didn't get a proper diagnosis until the age of 32, when he noticed his
daughter experiencing similar symptoms and started researching conditions on his
own, he said.
Stedman said he and his three-year-old daughter are a couple of the lucky
rare-disease sufferers because there is treatment available for them, but he
hopes Harris's proposed all-party committee could find a way to help more people
get proper diagnoses.
OMS: No cause, cure

Tony Tzoubris has one of the rarest diseases in the world, called
opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, or OMS.
It is named for the darting eyes and
muscle twitches that are hallmarks of the disease, which is also called
dancing-eyes-dancing-feet syndrome.
There is no known cause or cure for the
disease, which is also listed with the National Organization of Rare Diseases.
About 80 children are diagnosed with the disease each year worldwide.
Because it is so rare, both funding and help are scarce.
Insurance companies don't cover
experimental medicine or treatments - which, for Tony, is just about everything.
Even though little Tony's treatment costs
about $100,000 per year, they're not raising money for themselves.
When it comes to rare diseases, "everything" is money.
"I remember the doctor told us it was like the lottery of diseases," Patti said.
"It's that rare."
He's had treatments that last seven hours."
'You'd never know'

Tony doesn't know a life that didn't include needles, spinal taps, chemotherapy,
nuclear scans and painful treatments.

Tony Tzoubris received his diagnosis of the rare
disease more than two years ago, when he was 20 months old.
OMS at a glance - Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome - or OMS - is a rare
neurological disorder that usually affects infants and young children.
About half of those who are afflicted also have a
neuroblastoma, a rare, cancerous tumor.
The
other half of OMS patients apparently have no neuroblastoma.
In those cases,
doctors think the disease might be caused by a virus, a known cause of other
brain abnormalities.
- Behavior problems and brain damage are common outcomes in
OMS patients, even in those who respond favorably to treatment and, in very rare
cases, later show no signs of the disease.
- OMS is registered with National
Organization for Rare Disorders.

Sept. 07--The odds of contracting Guillain-Barre syndrome are almost as unlikely
as being struck by lightening.
Beginning with symptoms of numbness, the syndrome eventually causes total
paralysis.
Martin's experience is typical of victims with Guillain-Barre syndrome.
The
auto-immune syndrome attacks the body's nervous signals, destroying the myelin
sheath around the nerves and preventing the brain from sending signals to
nerves.
She
resented missing six months of her son's life, but Guillain-Barre syndrome is
only fatal in about 5 percent of its victims.

Paula Shal has a rare disease most of us have never heard of: cystinosis.
She makes it her mission to spread the word about what life is like
with a rare disease.
A disease is classified as rare in the U.S. if fewer than 200,000 people have
it.
About 30 million Americans suffer from one of
these curious disorders, or nearly one out of every 10 Americans: Rare diseases,
Shal points out, are a lot more common than most people realize.
Some sound like they are straight out of Dr. Seuss: cat eye syndrome (a
chromosomal disorder that leads to missing tissue in the eye's iris); Jumping
Frenchmen of Maine syndrome (an exaggerated reaction to unexpected noises or
sights); blue diaper syndrome (a metabolic disorder leading to bluish urine);
prune belly syndrome (symptoms include a lack of abdominal muscles).
Sometimes conditions once classified as rare, like autism, become all too
common.
A new disease called Sakati syndrome,
named like many of these illnesses after its discoverer, a Syrian physician, has
one known case study in the entire world - a young boy in the Middle East, says
Mary Dunkle, vice president of communications for the National Organization for
Rare Disorders, a nonprofit organization established in 1983 to help boost
awareness and research funding for these disorders.
A key challenge, Dunkle says, is persuading pharmaceutical companies and
universities to develop treatments for rare diseases given the few patients -
and profits.
Rare diseases are called orphan
diseases, Dunkle explains, because for so long patients have been "abandoned and
forgotten."
When rare diseases do become more familiar, it is often thanks to celebrities
coming down with them.
One example is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a
progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to paralysis and death.
Today the
illness is well known as Lou Gehrig's disease, after the beloved baseball star
felled by it.
In 2003, Guillain-Barre syndrome received a welcome dose of
publicity when researchers announced that it was probably this auto-immune
disease, and not polio, that struck Franklin Roosevelt in the prime of his life,
leaving him in a wheelchair.
But most rare diseases, and patients like Shal, remain stuck in relative
obscurity, which can make diagnosis and treatment a challenge.
One study found that one in seven patients with rare disorders goes undiagnosed
for more than six years.
On average, an accurate diagnosis can take nearly three
years - which delays treatment.
The disease primarily
affects children; without treatment, most will develop end-stage renal failure
by age 9 or 10.
Shal's late onset of the disease was unusual, says Gahl, who has
treated Shal and close to half of the patients in the U.S. suffering from the
rare ailment.
Gahl treats patients who suffer from other rare diseases, too.
Cystinosis used
to be a "death sentence," he says, but today treatments can control, if not yet
cure, the disease.
"I enjoy seeing these patients now," he says, "because I
actually know something about cystinosis.
"Shal has found few doctors in Wisconsin who have
seen other patients with cystinosis.
As a teen, she needed to fly out to
Maryland for treatment, where Gahl gave her an experimental drug called Cystagon
that she still takes every six hours.
Today Shal can order the drug, which has
been approved by the FDA, by mail from a Pennsylvania pharmacy that specializes
in medicine for rare diseases.
The disease has lead to a nasty tangle of complications, including kidney
failure.
She dreaded telling dates why she didn't want to grab a bite to eat, afraid that
if she explained she had a weird disease that made swallowing hard "they
wouldn't want to deal with all my issues."
"The Internet helps many
with rare diseases feel less isolated.
She keeps in touch online with 200 people with cystinosis around the
world, though mostly she networks with parents, since patients tend to be
children.
And a brother and sister with the disease in Seattle.
Her doctors say
this zest for life helps her overcome the challenges of a rare disease as much
as anything they can do for her.
On her way home from the grueling treatments, she stopped at nurseries
to shop for flowers.

Mum fears seven-year-old with rare genetic disorder will be denied potentially
life-saving medicine

A MUM fears her seven-year-old daughter with an incurable genetic disorder will
be denied medicine to extend and improve her quality of life following a policy
change at the NHS.
Jessica Stringer, of Holden Road, Leigh, was diagnosed with Hurler syndrome when
she was just four months old.
The rare condition causes progressive mental deficiency, liver and spleen
enlargement, dwarfism and unique facial features, with death caused by organ
damage frequently occurring by the age of 10.
With only 110 people in the UK having Hurler syndrome it qualifies as an 'ultra-
rare disease'.
Less new drugs and medicines for such conditions will be available through the
NHS following a joint consultation between NHS England and The National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
Megan claims this will prevent Jessica from being eligible for new medicines
developed for Hurler syndrome sufferers.
The 25-year-old mum-of-three said: "It is absolutely heartbreaking that I may
have to tell my daughter she can't have a new medicine which might make her
better or even cure her condition.
"Since she was born Jessica has taken 70 to 80 different medicines to help her
manage her condition so this NHS review and the changes are bound to affect
her."
Also known as MPS I, Hurler syndrome is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme
responsible for breaking down sugar in certain cells.
She has to spend most of her time in a wheelchair but Megan says her oldest
child's condition is 'stable at the moment' and that she is 'very determined and
always smiling'.
Voluntary support group MPS Society has set up an online petition asking for
people to oppose the NHS' new policy for medicines for ultra-rare diseases.
"It confirms that children and young adults with ultra-rare diseases are
economic pawns in a failing NHS."

Family 'elated' with drug funding; Province to pay cost of medicine for rare
condition

St. Albert father Dane Sadownyk picked up his three-yearold daughter Aleena and
"just hugged her" Monday morning when the family learned the Alberta government
will fund a crucial treatment for her rare medical condition.
Aleena's family and their supporters have been lobbying Alberta Health for a
month to approve treatment for Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome, a rare disease that
means she lacks glycosaminoglycan, an enzyme that helps break down cellular
waste.
Without treatment, sufferers see their life expectancy cut short.
Four other provinces have agreed to fund the treatment for seven children with
the syndrome - also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type VI or MPS VI - and
Aleena's family was pushing Alberta to quickly approve the expensive but
critical treatment, which is expected to initially cost about $300,000 a year.
Andrew McFayden, director of the Isaac Foundation, went through a similar
struggle in Ontario when his son Isaac was diagnosed with MPS VI as a toddler
and was the first to receive treatment in Canada.
But McFayden also said the happiness is mixed with frustration that it took so
long and that the family's supporters felt they had to mount a public campaign
with the support of MLAs such as Wildrose health critic Heather Forsyth, after
the family's original funding application through the Alberta Rare Disease
Program was denied.
"To me, that's a big
problem there still hasn't been a process put in place by Health Canada for
provinces to deal with funding these rare diseases."
Health Minister Fred Horne said Monday he signed offon the funding for Aleena's
treatment through Alberta's Short Term Evaluative Drug Therapy program, instead
of the Rare Disease program, because Aleena's case involves a drug not licensed
for sale in Canada.
Horne said he weighed several factors, including the clinical evidence, the
rarity of the disease, affordability of the drug and the best interest of the
patient.
But
these kinds of situations are becoming more common in Canada and it's because we
have more drugs coming out every day and more and more of these drugs are geared
to rare diseases."
Horne said he plans to talk about the need for an orphan drug program - a term
used to describe medications for rare diseases - with other provincial health
ministers and federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose.
Forsyth, MLA for Calgary-Fish Creek, said Alberta Health must work to make the
provincial system easier to navigate for families who suddenly find themselves
seeking help with a rare condition.
"The whole thing is just convoluted," said Forsyth, who said she was overwhelmed
to hear Aleena will receive treatment.
With Aleena's funding approved, the Sadownyks' next learning curve will be tied
to her treatment.

GRAPHIC: The Canadian Press; Aleena Sadownyk has Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, a
condition that affects her body's ability to break down cellular waste.
Medication for the condition currently costs about $300,000 per year.
Oscar has Maroteaux Lamy syndrome, a disease that only he and one other person
are known to suffer from.
A second bone marrow transplant halted the worsening of his condition but he
will always be tiny.
He has been performing hip-hop dance moves at schools to raise money for the
Rare Diseases Society of SA to help patients cover their huge medical expenses.
During his talks, Oscar tells school pupils that people with rare diseases want
to be treated like everyone else.
Kelly du Plessis, founder of the Rare Diseases Society, enlisted Oscar for his
dancing skills to help raise awareness of the NGO's work.
Yesterday was Rare Disease Day.
Du Plessis said more than 350-million people around the world suffer from 7000
rare diseases.
Though one in 10 people are estimated to have a rare disease, there is no rare
disease registry in South Africa.
Oscar is not the only South African with the distinction of having a disease
that no one else in the country has.
Less than two months later, Hendricks's worst nightmare came to life as doctors
diagnosed her son as having pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) - a rare
condition characterised by the inability to adequately regulate the amount of
sodium in the body.
There are an estimated 53 PHA1 patients worldwide.
Doctors say Riyaaz is the only South African known to have the disease.

Having a rare disease imposes a burden on patients, and a strain on the
doctor-patient relationship.
As Philippa Thomson observes in her book A Hole in
My Life: Battling Chronic Dizziness, the suffering caused by the condition is
compounded by "psychological despair, lack of therapeutic hope and the absence
of practical support".
She should know, because she has two very rare head conditions.
Superior
Semicircular Canal Syndrome, first identified in 1998, is caused by a thinning
of the temporal bone over the inner ear.
The syndrome
is often associated with symptoms of anxiety; Thomson has a long history of
panic attacks.
Following an unsuccessful operation, Thomson then developed Parasympathetic

COVER STORY RARE COURAGE

BYLINE: Juliana Kerr

SECTION: WEEKENDER; Pg.

LENGTH: 1158  words


It's every parent's worst nightmare: a child suffering in the grips of a disease
that has no name.
Three parents who have
faced this issue tell their story to JULIANA KERR

Although the issues they're dealing with are very different, the introduction of
a rare disease into their lives has united three women - Emily Barker, Kelli
Costa and Meagan Ross.
Together, they hope to raise the profile of those suffering from rare diseases
and to help put some support structures in place for those who don't know where
to turn.
The first step in their plan is the second annual Rare Disease Day Walk on
February 28.
Ethan has Dravet's Syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy).
Emily says this is not
typical epilepsy, but more a neurodegenerative condition.
"There's no treatment and there's no cure," Emily says.
Emily says it can be incredibly difficult to get the answers you need when
you're dealing with a raredisease.
WILLOW, INFANT, Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

Kelli Costa's daughter, Willow, was only 13 days old when she died of a rare
immune disorder called Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).
Kelli eventually learned that she and her husband are each missing the same
gene, which is rare in itself.
A bone marrow transplant would have been the treatment for the condition, but
Willow was too young.
She has spent hours researching in her
quest for answers and hopes her experience might help someone else facing the
same condition.
In the meantime, she hopes
her own story will help raise awareness of rare diseases and the obstacles faced
by those who deal with them.
Molly Cross, 2 , diagnosed with Angelman Syndrome

When her daughter, Molly, now two and a half, was diagnosed with Angelman
Syndrome, Meagan Cross didn't know where to go for information or help.
She was distressed to discover there was no central body for rare diseases in
Australia.
It is her hope that raising awareness about the not-so-rare instances
of rare diseases will lead to the creation of a database or resources that could
be accessed by those seeking answers.
Angelman Syndrome is a neurological-genetic disorder that can be characterised
by global development delays and severe speech impairment.
That
would be my ultimate goal - a body that could offer support to people whatever
the condition.
In the hopes of helping others facing a rare disease, Meagan has launched a
website, www.mollysvoice.org, to share stories and experiences that may assist
others with finding answers.
For more information on the Rare Disease Day Walk or how you can get involved in
raising awareness, email meags@mollysvoice.org or phone 0419 545 521.
But she desperately wanted
support for the crises she knew would crop up as she raised a son with a rare
disease.
Her larger questions concerned the impact that Moebius syndrome, a disorder that
causes lifetime facial paralysis, would have on her son, Sean, as he grew up,
coping with symptoms from blinking eyes to drooling and trouble swallowing.
McCarrell read everything she could get her hands on, called authors of
scientific articles and wrote to the National Organization for Rare Disorders,
(in Canada, there's the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders at
403-345-4544.)
The group, the best resource in the U.S. for people with rare diseases, helped
her find support groups for people with facial differences.
McCarrell and Thomas formed what is now the Moebius Syndrome Foundation.
Empowered by the Internet, people with rare diseases are connecting and sharing
information about their obstacles and how they have overcome them.
At members.aol.com/PACALI/index.html you'll find Carol Ferensak's way of helping
others with nail patella syndrome, a disorder that causes bone and nail
deformities and possible eye and kidney problems.
Two siblings as well as her daughter have the disease.

Walking for Phoenix; school visits student suffering from rare disease

BYLINE: Deangelo McDaniel, The Decatur Daily, Ala.
In
January, she was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnsons syndrome, a rare and serious
disorder of the skin's mucous membranes.
The disease begins with flu-like symptoms, which Phoenix had, followed by
painful rashes and blisters that ultimately causes the top layer of skin to die.
Nicole
said this was the first time she and her husband Joey heard the term
Stevens-Johnsons syndrome from doctors.
"We were told she might have this or toxic shock syndrome," she said.
On Jan. 12, doctors transferred Phoenix to the burn unit at Children's Hospital
of Birmingham for treatment.

Sports-mad Eoin fights rare disease

LENGTH: 458 words



HIGHLIGHT: A Derry boy with a rare disease had his dreams come true last
weekend, thanks to a charity who transformed him into a rally driver for the
day.
12 year-old Eoin Buckley, who was diagnosed with Charge Syndrome a short time
after his birth, realised his life-long dream of becoming a rally driver after
his father James contacted the Share A Dream Foundation.
Charge Syndrome,, which affects roughly one in every 100,000 children has a
number of different effects including heart and renal problems, delayed puberty,
eye defects and growth problems.
"It is a really really rare disease and we haven't met anyone else in Northern
Ireland who has it," Marie told the 'Journal.'
The Buckley family have never been offered support for Eoin's syndrome because
it is so rare.
Some people with Charge Syndrome live long
happy lives but others don't," Maria said.

A North Lynn mother is hoping to raise awareness of the rare disease which
affects her six-year-old daughter.
Ellie-Mai Bunting was diagnosed with Blau Syndrome after her mother Victoria
Williamson had spotted fatty deposits around her wrists.
Blau Syndrome is a genetic condition which affects joints, eyes and skin.
Arthritis is a common feature of the condition.
Ellie-Mai has to undergo fortnightly injections to control the painful condition
which would prevent her from moving around.
She also has to take daily pain and anti-inflamatory drugs to help control the
condition along with other medication.
An ultra-sound also showed which showed her kidney, liver and spleen were
enlarged, which are other symptoms of the condition.

Kittanning family copes with rare disease

BYLINE: Mitch Fryer, The Leader Times, Kittanning, Pa.
Those are the words that Joe and Shelly Keys of Kittanning live by in raising
two of their children, 2-year-old McKenah and 7-month-old Josiah, who both have
the same rare disease, arthrogryposis.
The odds of two children in the same family getting the genetic form of
arthrogryposis known as Escobar Syndrome is astronomical.
There are only 50 cases of Escobar
Syndrome and only seven families in the world that have more than one child
affected with Escobar Syndrome.
The reason that the Keys had two children with the disease is because McKenah
went undiagnosed until a month before Josiah's birth.
When Shelly was pregnant with McKenah, the doctors diagnosed the unborn baby
with a different disease and gave her no chance of living.
When Josiah was born, they knew immediately that he also had the disease.
On Saturday, the congregation is having a benefit concert to help raise funds to
be used for any unexpected costs that surface as Josiah and McKenah grow and to
help in educating the local community to this syndrome in children.
Cost: $10 pre-order; $12 at the door; children 12 and other are free

Investigation launched into suspected cluster of rare disease which may have
struck down six victims in ONE tiny town;
Fears after rare and fatal disease hits six locals

BYLINE: By Garreth MacNamee

An investigation has been launched into a suspected cluster of a rare disease
which may have struck down six victims in ONE tiny town.
There have already been four confirmed cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) in
Duleek, Co Meath, and two more men are now feared to have caught the illness.
The syndrome - which affects the nervous system - usually hits one in 100,000
people.
But in Duleek, a town of just 6,000 residents, there should be only a
0.00001% chance of six people contracting the disease.
He said: "I understand that the condition is very rare and normally affects one
person in every 80,000 - 100,000.
"The HSE has agreed to follow up on these cases to look at possible causes for
this apparent clustering of cases and will be meeting with the individual
patients in the near future to progress that investigation."

Rare diseases hard for most docs to diagnose

BYLINE: By Suzanne Bohan, STAFF WRITER

SECTION: ARGUS

LENGTH: 1238 words


Medical students commonly hear the phrase, "If you hear hoof beats, think
horses, not zebras."
The adage reflects a core tenet of the art of medical diagnoses: It's more
productive to first assume common diseases are the cause of most patients'
symptoms, rather than exotic disorders.
That medical mindset was evident when Kaycee Antosiak, a vivacious 12-year-old
Los Altos girl, sought treatment for her crippling pain after a dog bite.
Three months after the dog attack, she was referred to a Stanford University
physician, Dr. Elliot Krane, who correctly diagnosed her as afflicted with a
rare genetic disease called complex regional pain syndrome.
The condition causes
excruciating chronic pain, long after the generally minor injury that triggered
it healed.
"These patients think their foot is immersed in boiling water all of the time,"
said Krane, a pediatric anesthesiologist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital,
who last week at Stanford led the first conference worldwide to seek faster
diagnoses and better treatment of the condition.
With the extraordinary challenge of diagnosing these uncommon conditions, and
medical training that encourages doctors to focus on familiar causes of disease,
most patients with rare disorders run through a gauntlet of doctors before --
for the lucky ones -- they end up referred to the unique physician with the
knowledge to correctly pinpoint their disorder.
Krane recognized
within minutes the disease afflicting Kaycee when he first saw her in November
2005 and immediately started her on treatment.
Occasionally, she said, her
ankle still aches and she's aware she's vulnerable for life from the condition,
absent the development of a treatment that permanently ends the pain.
While only a few hundred other Americans suffer from the condition, Kaycee and
others with complex regional pain syndrome are among the ranks of the 30 million
Americans suffering from one of the nearly 7,000 known rare diseases, according
to Dr. Steven Groft, director of the Office of Rare Diseases with the National
Institutes of Health.
The NIH defines a rare disease as one affecting 200,000 or
fewer Americans.
The prevalence of those living with these unusual conditions numerically rivals
the 40 million Americans with one or more of the three major diseases: heart
disease, cancer or diabetes.
The number of patients identified with a rare disease also is expected to swell
with expanding knowledge of the human genome, said Groft.
Rare diseases are
usually attributed to genetics.
"What we're finding is that as more information becomes available, there are
more and more patients who have the rare disorder," Groft said.
And physicians committed to researching and providing treating for one of these
strange maladies often push into medical frontiers to improve the lives of their
patients.
The Stanford conference on complex regional pain syndrome, held May 30 and May
31, drew dozens of experts from a variety of disciplines.
The conference yielded
a consensus paper on better diagnoses and optimal treatment for the condition,
which emphasizes physical therapy with the use of pain medications to ease the
initial agony of exercise, the same therapy Krane used with Kaycee.
These kinds of conferences are vital for improving the medical profession's
track record for diagnosing unique diseases, said Groft.
And even though doctors
often have few if any treatments to offer, the diagnosis allows patients and
their families to band with others with the condition to seek the best
treatments and advocate for research.
"Many advocacy groups can help patients live a little better life," said Groft.
Furthermore, the NIH budget for rare disease research is robust, he added.
Of
the $29 billion awarded by the NIH last year for medical research grants, $4
billion, or 18 percent, went to studying rare diseases.
The grants often fund
clinical trials that give patients with few or no options a chance to try
potential treatments, Groft emphasized.
So there
can be hope for people with rare diseases."
Krane pointed hopefully to a future in which genetic tests of blood samples will
quickly provide answers to the questions that now vex physicians encountering
patients with mysterious ailments.
Until and if such swift diagnoses of rare diseases come to pass, Groft said
those with disorders that defy treatment can best cope with their frustration
and fear by seeking access to specialists.
"No one can be expected to know that many disorders," he said of the rare
diseases so far identified.
"We encourage patients to be referred upward in the
medical system to specialists."
Donna Antosiak calls Krane "my favorite person in the whole wide world," while
Kaycee said she doubts she would be walking today without his treatment.

Alberta will fund girl's treatment

DATELINE: EDMONTON


St. Albert father Dane Sadownyk picked up his three-year-old daughter Aleena and
"just hugged her" Monday morning when the family learned the Alberta government
will fund a crucial treatment for her rare medical condition.
Aleena's family and their supporters have been lobbying Alberta Health for a
month to approve treatment for Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome, a rare disease that
means she lacks glycosaminoglycan, an enzyme that helps break down cellular
waste.
Without treatment,
sufferers see their life expectancy cut short.
Four other provinces have agreed to
fund the treatment for seven children with the syndrome - also known as
mucopolysaccharidosis type VI or MPS VI - and Aleena's family was pushing
Alberta to quickly approve the expensive but critical treatment, which is
expected to initially cost about $300,000 a year.
Andrew McFayden, director of the Isaac Foundation, went through a similar
struggle in Ontario when his son Isaac was diagnosed with MPS VI as a toddler
and was the first to receive treatment in Canada.
But McFayden also said the happiness is mixed with frustration that it took so
long and that the family's supporters felt they had to mount a public campaign
with the support of MLAs such as Wildrose health critic Heather Forsyth after
the family's original funding application through the Alberta Rare Disease
Program was denied.
"To me, that's a big
problem there still hasn't been a process put in place by Health Canada for
provinces to deal with funding these rare diseases."
Health Minister Fred Horne
said Monday he signed off on the funding for Aleena's treatment through
Alberta's Short Term Evaluative Drug Therapy program, instead of the Rare
Disease program, because Aleena's case involves a drug not licensed for sale in
Canada.
Horne said he weighed several factors, including the clinical evidence, the
rarity of the disease, affordability of the drug and the best interest of the
patient.
But
these kinds of situations are becoming more common in Canada and it's because we
have more drugs coming out every day and more and more of these drugs are geared
to rare diseases."
Horne said he plans to talk about the need for an orphan drug program - a term
used to describe medications for rare diseases - with other provincial health
ministers and federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose.
Forsyth, MLA for Calgary-Fish Creek, said Alberta Health must work to make the
provincial system easier to navigate for families who suddenly find themselves
seeking help with a rare condition.
"The whole thing is just convoluted," said Forsyth, who said she was overwhelmed
to hear Aleena will receive treatment.

Rare Diseases, High Medical Expenses Cause Families Distress

LENGTH: 562 words

DATELINE: BENGALURU


BENGALURU, March 2 -- Patients with rare health disorders and their families are
seeking the government's help to meet their high medical expenses.
The disorders include haemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (DMD), pompe, Asperger syndrome and primary immunodeficiency
disease (PID).
Shanthi Ganesh has a 24-year-old son, Neelesh Ganesh, with Asperger's syndrome.
"Even an upper middle class family cannot afford the treatment expenses," she
said, urging the government to step in and help.
Dr Namitha Kumar, Research Director, Centre for Health Ecologies and Technology,
says the exact cause of Asperger's syndrome is not known.
Similarly, haemophilia patients face difficult odds.
If the government comes up with a care
centre, poor patients will not be so badly burdened."
A patient spends
Rs 2.5 to 3 lakh a year to treat the condition.
The condition is treated by infusing a clotting factor (drug),
which remains active for a short time.
And one in every 5,000
men is detected with this condition.
"Due to low awareness, people with the condition don't also get brides and
grooms," he said.
This is the largest rare disease population to be recorded.
Doctors say patients who require blood transfusion regularly are also at risk of
contracting hepatitis and AIDS.

Globally, 7,000 rare diseases are listed, and nearly 70 million people in India
suffer from such diseases.
The Centre for Health
Ecologies and Technology at the International Institute of Art, Culture and
Democracy, Bengaluru, had recently organised the Blue Ribbon Art Exhibition and
Film Festival under its Autism and Rare Diseases Awareness outreach programme.

Audentes Therapeutics Announces Commencement of LUSTRO, Clinical Assessment,
Phase 1/2 Run-in Study of Patients with Crigler-Najjar Syndrome

LENGTH: 361  words


March 1 -- Audentes Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BOLD), a biotechnology company
focused on developing and commercializing gene therapy products for patients
living with serious, life-threatening rare diseases, today announced the
commencement of LUSTRO, a prospective study designed to characterize the disease
course in patients living with Crigler-Najjar Syndrome.
LUSTRO will evaluate
subjects prior to potential enrollment in VALENS, the planned Phase 1/2 clinical
study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of AT342, the Audentes
product candidate being developed to treat Crigler-Najjar Syndrome.
"LUSTRO is designed to further our understanding of the baseline
characteristics of patients living with Crigler-Najjar Syndrome, and the burden
of disease as experienced by patients, families and caregivers.
We greatly
appreciate the opportunity to work with the Crigler-Najjar community and view
the initiation of LUSTRO as an important milestone as we seek to develop an
innovative gene therapy for this devastating rare disease."
LUSTRO is an international study of approximately 16 to 18 Crigler-Najjar
patients one year of age or older.
The primary objectives of LUSTRO are to
characterize the disease course, natural history, serum bilirubin variability
and phototherapy usage of Crigler-Najjar patients.
LUSTRO will also assess the
burden of disease on Crigler-Najjar patients and caregivers.
In addition,
LUSTRO has been designed as a run-in study to identify patients for potential
enrollment in VALENS, the planned Phase 1/2 study of AT342, and is intended to
serve as a longitudinal baseline and within-patient control for subjects who
enroll in VALENS.

Auspex Pharmaceuticals Receives FDA Orphan Drug Designation of SD-809 for
Treatment of Tourette Syndrome in Pediatric Population

LENGTH: 333  words


Jan. 14 -- US-based Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. issued the following news
release:

Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ASPX), a biopharmaceutical company
dedicated to developing innovative medicines for people with movement disorders
and other rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to Auspex's
investigational compound SD-809 for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in the
pediatric population (defined as zero through 16 years of age).
Auspex is
currently evaluating the preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetic and safety
profile of SD-809 in a Phase 1b clinical trial for the treatment of tics
associated with Tourette syndrome.
In November 2014, SD-809 was granted orphan drug designation by the
FDA for the treatment of Huntington's disease.
"Receiving orphan drug designation of SD-809 for the treatment of Tourette
syndrome, in addition to Huntington's disease, is an important step forward in
our goal of bringing this novel treatment approach to the patients and families
affected by these serious disorders," said Pratik Shah, president and CEO of
Auspex.
"There have been no new drugs developed for Tourette syndrome in over 30
years.
The orphan drug designation recognizes the significant need that exists
among children living with this debilitating disease, and we look forward to
assessing the potential role that SD-809 may have in addressing that."
The FDA's Orphan Drug program offers orphan status to drugs and biologics that
are intended for the treatment of rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000
people in the U.S.

A MOTHER is hoping her fund-raising exploits will raise awareness about a rare
disease that has affected her family.
Cerys Goddard says very little is known about Sturge-Weber Syndrome.
So much so that following her son Freddie's diagnosis last month, many nurses,
doctors and consultants she has since met had never heard of the condition.
Cerys, from Whitecross, Hereford, said: "We always knew from when he was born
that it was possible he would develop the syndrome, but we were told that if he
made it to a year with no seizures he would be okay.
"But at about 20 months old he started having seizures and was diagnosed with
epilepsy and then the syndrome.
I
kept in touch with a Sturge-Weber page on Facebook where you can talk to other
people who have experience of the condition.
Freddie is having
lazer treatment on his birthmark and he has many potential challenges ahead of
him but he's very brave."

PURPLE may not be used in Ballarat Clarendon College's uniform, but students and
teachers donned a splash of the colour to raise money for Sanfilippo Syndrome on
Wednesday.
It is one of many ways the school will raise money for research into the rare
disease, which has attacked teacher Mark Robson's five-year-old daughter Skye.
School head of community service Jenny Tischler said the school supported things
close to home and the community, and students had pushed for something to be
done relating to the disease.
Skye's life expectancy is between 12 and 20 years, with the degenerative fatal
disease in its initial stages.
She said the college had chosen a touch of purple as purple was the colour used
for rare diseases.
"Rare Disease Day was celebrated on February 28, which was a Saturday which
didn't suit us at school, so we decided to do something now," she said.
Ms Tischler said the main aim of the week was to raise awareness for Sanfilippo
syndrome and hoped the whole school would know and understand something about it
by the end of the week.
"Hopefully, this will help find a cure for Skye and help others with the rare
disease."

It took more than six years for Palmerston North boy Oscar van Dyk to be
diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder.
The 11-year-old is now living with Coffin Lowry Syndrome, which affects him
intellectually and physically.
Symptoms of the condition include a short stature, skeletal abnormalities,
distinct facial features, and delayed language and motor skills.
Children with the syndrome can also be diagnosed with autism, epilepsy,
scoliosis, heart conditions and dental abnormalities.
The condition affects boys more severely than girls.
Mrs van Dyk spoke to the Manawatu Standard about her son's complex condition
ahead of Rare Disease Day tomorrow.
Mrs van Dyk said it was tough learning to bring up a child with a rare syndrome
and very little support.
"We belong to the worldwide Facebook group for the
condition," she said.
New Zealand Organisation for Rare Disorders (NZORD) executive director John
Forman said Rare Disease Day was a chance for individuals and small groups to
raise awareness and raise funds for their chosen condition.
"The key reason for community awareness is the relative neglect of rare
diseases.
Mr Forman said Rare Disease Day is held internationally, with more than 60
countries and hundreds of patient groups participating.
Little Liam Heffernan, four, suffers from rare Batten's Disease, a genetic
disorder which took the life of his older sister, Saoirse, at the age of five in
January 2011.
But now his determined parents Tony and Mary are hoping to see their children's
legacy live on through the establishment of a care centre for children affected
by rare disease and genetic conditions.
These will be used to care for children with rare diseases while giving parents
and siblings the chance to get some rest.
Conditions Children who suffer from Cystic Fibrosis, Duchenne, Marfan Syndrome,
Angelman's Syndrome and many other lesser known conditions would be able to
avail of much-needed help from Liam's Lodge.
Tony said: "With little Government supports, we are appealing to people across
Ireland to help give a muchneeded break to the families of children with rare
diseases.
Rare diseases affect more than eight per cent of Ireland's population.
More than 50 per cent of kids with rare disease are highly
dependent and many rely on roundthe-clock care.

It would take another two years and a heartbreaking regression in Zoe's limited
skills before the family would first hear the words Rett syndrome.
The non-specific symptoms of rare conditions unfamiliar to most doctors led to
long delays in diagnosis, said Professor Elliott, whose establishment of the
unit 15 years ago determined the prevalence in Australia of some rare diseases -
most of which are genetic and first manifest in childhood.
Rare diseases, she said, "have been systematically neglected".
Specialists from around Australia now plan to campaign to "get rare diseases on
the map, to make sure there is equitable access to services", for those whose
disorder does not trigger a well-established package of care.
National referral clinics for doctors baffled by a patient's unusual symptoms
could shorten diagnosis time, Professor Elliott said, and a network of such
clinics could facilitate contact and mutual support between families grappling
with the realities frightening and unfamiliar diseases.

People on Deer Isle have a special interest in a rare disease called SPG4.
And researchers keep looking for cases of another rare disease, Alstrom syndrome
, with a cluster of victims in the nearby Canadian Maritime Provinces.
Dr. Robert Beekman of Ellsworth, a specialist in the disease, relates its
concentration on Deer Isle to the long isolation of the community there.
He
consults with Deer Isles residents who have the disease or fear they may get it.
Alstrom syndrome is far more serious.
Jan D. Marshall, a genetics researcher at Jackson Laboratory, a
specialist in the disease, knows of three cases in New Brunswick and five or six
in Nova Scotia.
Both are so rare that the big genetic companies see no
profitability in starting expensive research into their causes and possible
cures.
In the meantime, they direct interested people to Web
sites and organizations that bring together patients and researchers.
And a
Jackson Lab colleague of Ms. Marshall has bred two Alstrom mouse models that
they hope can lead to an understanding of the functioning of the Alstrom gene
mutation as a first step toward dealing with the disease in humans.
In the meantime, specialists in such rare diseases hope that Gov.
John Baldacci
will join other states in designating Feb. 28 as Rare Disease Day to spread
awareness and provide information and hope.

Novartis Receives Positive CHMP Recommendation for Ilaris to Treat Rare Diseases
in Adults, Children Called Periodic Fever Syndromes

LENGTH: 778  words


Dec. 16 -- Novartis announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products
for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended approval of Ilaris (canakinumab) in Europe
to treat three rare and distinct Periodic Fever Syndromes.
If approved, Ilaris will be the first and only approved biologic treatment in
Europe for Tumor Necrosis Factor-Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS),
Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)/Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) and
Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).
"Few treatments exist for people with these potentially life-threatening
conditions.
Today's positive recommendation is a great stride forward for
patients who urgently need new treatment options," said Paul Hudson, CEO,
Novartis Pharmaceuticals.
"Novartis is committed to paving the way forward for
rare diseases especially through treatments like Ilaris which has the potential
to raise the standard of care."
Results showed rapid (at Day 15) and sustained
disease control with Ilaris compared to placebo through 16 weeks, in patients
with either TRAPS, HIDS/MKD or FMF[3].
Data show Ilaris to be a well-tolerated
and effective treatment for these three rare conditions.
All three conditions are part of a group of rare autoinflammatory diseases
called Periodic Fever Syndromes, which are also referred to as Hereditary
Periodic Fevers (HPF).
The most common syndrome is FMF,
which mainly affects people of Eastern Mediterranean ancestry.
In August 2016, the European Commission approved Ilaris for a license extension
to treat patients with Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD), a rare type of
inflammatory arthritis.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously
granted three simultaneous approvals of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS,
HIDS/MKD and FMF in September 2016.
About Periodic Fever Syndromes

Periodic Fever Syndromes are a group of diseases that cause serious recurrent
fever and pathogenic inflammation through non-infectious activation of the
immune system.
Most patients present with symptoms in infancy or childhood, but
in some patients the condition only becomes apparent or diagnosed in
adulthood[1].
Previous treatments for these rare conditions consisted of oral
anti-inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids, which were used only to help
manage the symptoms.
Excessive production of IL-1 beta plays a prominent role in
certain inflammatory diseases[5],[6].
Ilaris is currently approved and marketed for the treatment of Systemic Juvenile
Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) in the US and EU and for the treatment of AOSD and
the symptomatic treatment of refractory acute gouty arthritis in the EU.
Ilaris
is also approved in more than 70 countries, including in the EU, Switzerland,
US, Canada, and Japan for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic
Syndromes (CAPS): rare, lifelong, genetic disorders with debilitating symptoms.
In the EU, Ilaris is approved for following subtypes of CAPS: Muckle-Wells
syndrome (MWS), neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID)/chronic
infantile neurological, cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA), severe forms of
familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS)/familial cold urticaria (FCU)

A woman whose immune system is attacking her body's cells - one of only about 30
people in Ontario with the condition.
A mother who took her children to the
United States so they could regain some mobility lost due to their rare
connective tissue disorder.
A man whose rare condition went undiagnosed for 32
years until he took research into his own hands.
Those three people came to the Ontario legislature Monday as representatives of
the recent wave of rare disease sufferers who had pleaded with the government
for help, and who are now looking for a comprehensive strategy.
Michael Harris, a Progressive Conservative MPP, said a new group of people with
rare diseases could easily show up at the legislature every week, or maybe even
every day.
Jennifer Hamilton is one of about 30 people in Ontario with atypical hemolytic
uremic syndrome, or aHUS, a life-threatening condition in which the immune
system attacks the body's cells, damaging blood vessels.
He applauded Harris for his advocacy on behalf of rare disease sufferers, but
wouldn't say yet if the Liberal government will support the motion.
Chantelle Willson, a nurse and mother of four from Brantford, said her husband
and two of her children have been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a
hereditary connective tissue disorder.
Ian Stedman has Muckle-Wells Syndrome, characterized by full-body rashes, fevers
and joint pain, and said he had made 176 visits to the doctor before he was 18.
He didn't get a proper diagnosis until the age of 32, when he noticed his
daughter having similar symptoms and started researching conditions on his own,
he said.
Stedman said he and his three-year-old daughter are some of the lucky rare
disease sufferers because there is treatment available for them, but he hopes
Harris's proposed committee could find a way to help more people get proper
diagnoses.

Watching her best friend battle the rare disease Behcet's syndrome, Isabel
Cochrane felt helpless.
After Ruth Page died, Isabel vowed to raise awareness of the disease, and will
be running the Bath Half Marathon next month.
After
visiting a number of doctors she was diagnosed with the syndrome, a rare disease
that causes inflammation of the blood vessels leading to painful ulcers.
Isabel, a student at the University of Bath, said: "It is a really horrible
disease, which can be very painful.
Isabel is
in training to run 13.1 miles to raise money and awareness for the Behcet's
Syndrome Society.
"I have done a bit of running, and thought it would be a good way to raise money
to help others with the disease.
"Ruth always used to say how hardly anyone knew
what Behcet's is, and so this is a good opportunity to raise awareness of the
disease."

Diagnosis was like a lightbulb going on ;
Many people who havethe rare 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are not diagnosed until
adulthood

BYLINE: James Fogarty

SECTION: HEALTH; Pg.
She has
the rare condition 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is caused by the deletion of
a small piece of chromosome 22.
"She didn't have a congenital
heart defect [which is a common feature of the syndrome] but she was always
sick.
People with the syndrome often have no known family history of the syndrome even
though an affected parent has a 50 per cent risk of passing the deletion to
their child.
As well as heart defects, the syndrome is associated with kidney, eye and
immune-system problems, as well as educational difficulties and mental health
conditions such as schizophrenia.
All told, there are about 180 symptoms associated with the syndrome.
Despite being the second most common genetic cause of congenital heart disease
after Down syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome was identified only in the early
1990s and this has led to a lack of awareness among the public and healthcare
professionals, says Kieran Murphy, professor of psychiatry at the Royal College
of Surgeons in Ireland, who is an expert in the syndrome.
"It's known by a number of other names, because previously they weren't
recognised as the same syndrome," he says.
Complexity of the syndrome It took another seven years and an international
conference, when Ãine was 22, for Anne to be able to accept fully the complexity
of the syndrome.
As a result, and with Murphy's help, Anne and a number of other parents founded
22q11.2 Ireland, a support group for families living with the syndrome.
Even within families some siblings
will have the syndrome but with different issues and problems."
He explains that the
frequency of the condition is estimated to be about one in 4,000, and believes
it is going under the radar.
"Given the varied ways in which the condition can manifest, and the different
ages at which problems can occur, the condition is definitely under-recognised,"
says Green.
"There is certainly a lack of awareness of 22q11.2 deletion among health
professionals, and we need to focus much more on education about the condition."
However, he adds that the paediatric cardiologists and cleft-palate teams, who
see babies with two of the major early manifestations of the syndrome, are very
aware of the condition.
They regularly request genetic testing for the condition
on patients.
When the parents of these children were screened, some
were discovered to have the syndrome and to be leading perfectly normal lives."
For children, given the range of difficulties that can accompany the syndrome,
diagnosis is key, he stresses.
The diagnosis makes sense of things and we
can then screen for the difficulties that people with this syndrome experience.
"For example, people with the syndrome can have very high rates of anxiety
disorders, ADHD and autism, and it's very important these are identified and
appropriate treatment given."
"If we know the child has the syndrome there are ways in
which the child can be taught that maximises their ability to learn."
According to the HSE, Ireland currently does not have a registry of people
diagnosed with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
However, according to a HSE
spokeswoman, "the condition is recognised as a rare disease and will be included
in the work of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases in the HSE".
While the recent publication of the National Rare Disease Plan has given Anne
hope, she believes much remains to be done.

A PROPOSED respite centre for children with rare diseases and their families is
to receive its very own library worth (EURO)1,500 as part of the Bord Gáis
Energy 'Donate a Library' initiative.
Liam's Lodge aims to cater for the medical, educational and recreational needs
of the families of children with rare diseases - such as Cystic Fibrosis, Marfan
Syndrome, Angelman's Syndrome and many other lesser known conditions.
Receiving a brand
new library worth (EURO)1,500 is a massive boost to the project, explained
Liam's Lodge founder, Tony Heffernan, who lost his two children to Batten's
disease.
The research showed that providing education about conditions that cause facial
paralysis helps people correct their misperceptions.
Bogart is an expert on ableism, or prejudice about disabilities, and her
research focuses on the psychosocial implications of facial movement disorders
such as facial paralysis and Parkinson's disease, which affect more than 200,000
Americans.
Her interest stems from personal experience; she has Moebius syndrome
, a rare congenital neurological disorder characterized by facial paralysis and
impaired lateral eye movement.
"We found that awareness and education efforts are effective in reducing stigma
related to rare disabilities such as facial paralysis," Bogart said.
"That could
have a broad impact on the rare disease community, because many rare diseases
are unrecognizable.
People who encounter someone with a rare disease may not
understand or know how to adapt to communicate with them."
Bogart is now developing educational materials about Moebius Syndrome targeted
to educators and health care providers.
She and the students in her lab also are
conducting an awareness campaign in conjunction with Moebius Syndrome Awareness
Day, which is held annually on Jan. 24.
The Moebius Syndrome Foundation and several other
college campuses are also participating in the campaign.
In the future, Bogart hopes to study the effectiveness of such educational
efforts to determine if more information should be included, if other types of
groups might be targeted or if there are other ways to enhance understanding of
rare diseases such as facial paralysis.

A 10-year-old New Brunswick boy suffering from a rare and often fatal disease
will receive an expensive treatment for his illness for one year, the province's
health minister said Wednesday, reversing a decision the government made earlier
this year.
Victor Boudreau issued a brief statement saying the province will pay for up to
12 month's worth of Vimizim to assess its effectiveness in treating Morgan
Doucet, who has Morquio syndrome.
She said Morgan is in declining health because the disease causes an enzyme
deficiency that leads to many complications.
However, he issued a
statement saying New Brunswick will work with other provinces to devise a
national approach to reviewing expensive drugs for rare diseases.
Durhane Wong-Rieger, CEO of the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders, said
every province faces the same thorny questions when residents ask for help
paying for pricey medications for rare ailments.
"Most rare-disease drugs don't go on to anybody's formulary," she said,
referring to the list of drugs each province is willing to routinely pay for.
Wong-Rieger says the criteria for that review process was never meant to deal
with rare-disease drugs.
Last month, the Saskatchewan government said it would pay for one year of
Vimizim treatments for three siblings who have Morquio syndrome.

Akari Therapeutics Announces Receipt of Orphan Drug Designation for Coversin
from US FDA for Treatment of Guillain Barre Syndrome

LENGTH: 360  words


May 12 -- Akari Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AKTX), an emerging growth,
development-stage biopharmaceutical company, announced today that the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted to Akari an Orphan Drug Designation
for recombinant protein inhibitor of compliment factor 5 for the treatment of
Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS).
Guillain Barre syndrome is an acute immune-mediated post infectious
polyneuropathy where the immune system is triggered into attacking peripheral
nerves, leading to progressive, fairly symmetric muscle weakness and paralysis
accompanied by absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes.
"Studies of Guillain Barre
Syndrome show that up to 35% of patients can have long-term neurological
complications despite best care and it is critical to expand the range of
treatment options available to these patients."
The FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation status to products that treat rare
diseases, providing incentives to sponsors developing drugs or biologics.
The
FDA defines rare diseases as those affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the
United States at the time of designation.

Teresa's son, Corey, five, who attends Preston Primary School, suffers from a
disorder called MPS1 or Hurler syndrome.
She said: "If these rare diseases could be diagnosed earlier in childhood, then
treatments are often more effective because less damage has occurred.
MPS stands for  mucopolysaccharidosis, a rare genetic disorder which is marked
by progressive deterioration of the organs.
Hurler syndrome, The strain that Corey suffers from,  has an overall frequency
of one per 100,000 people and is currently incurable.
Teresa added: "Corey has had the only treatment available which slows down the
progression of the disease, but there is no cure."

Paisley teenager Lucas Webster may be the only person in the world to be
diagnosed with a combination of two rare diseases, but his mum says that is not
the only reason he is unique.
The 16-year-old was born with an abnormal chromosome and an extremely rare
condition called Townes-Brocks syndrome.
His mum Sandra, 50, says doctors have told her that there are no other reported
cases where a patient has both of these genetic conditions.
As the world marks Rare Disease Day today, she explained the impact Lucas's
health problems have had on her and the rest of her family.
He was born with a genetic disorder, which Sandra explains created extra
material on chromosome one, and Townes-Brocks Syndrome, which affects just one
in 250,000 people - but she only had that confirmed after taking to the internet
for answers.
I came across a boy with something called Townes-Brocks Syndrome and
I knew that is what Lucas had.
"At that time, there was a place in Germany testing for it, so we had blood sent
there and the tests confirmed that he suffered from the syndrome.
Sandra, who used to work at the Disability Resource Centre, added: "With it
being Rare Disease Day today, I will be thinking about other families in the
same position as me. "
There are lots of families affected by rare illnesses
across Renfrewshire.
"People may not be aware of these conditions and how they can impact on the
lives of families, so Rare Disease Day is a chance for us to reflect on that."

Boy cured of rare illness after two stem cell grafts;
Doctors in Singapore have cured a baby of Omenn syndrome, the first known case
of the extremely rare disease here.
"Every disease has its own time line," explained Dr Soh.
"There tends to be a
very specific sequence in which the features of each disease occur."
Dr Soh recalled his readings some years earlier on rare diseases, one of which
resembled Donovan's situation.
The consensus: It all pointed to
Omenn syndrome, a condition so rare that it has never before been reported in
Singapore.
If not treated, Omenn syndrome is fatal.
Added Dr Soh: "It's very, very rare; it would be easier to strike the lottery.
The only treatment was a transplant of blood-forming or cord blood stem cells.
His overjoyed parents reiterated how grateful they are to the doctors, nurses,
surgeons and therapists for saving Donovan, be it from the ICU, renal, oncology,
immunology or infectious diseases teams.
After numerous tests,
doctors discovered he had Omenn syndrome, a very rare disease and a severe form
of immunodeficiency.
With him in the picture are his parents, Mr Tay (left) and Ms Lee, and
Dr Soh, who diagnosed his condition.

Ottawa weighs costs of rare disease treatment

DATELINE: OTTAWA


OTTAWA - Mackenzie Olsen is just one of dozens of rare disease patients in
Canada who are left without treatment, and perhaps a future, because the
government has no strategy for funding costly but potentially life-saving
therapies.
The nine-year-old Alberta boy, who suffers from an unusual genetic disorder
called Hurler-Schele syndrome, must wait until at least July for Ottawa to
decide if it will pay for his $17,000 per week enzyme replacement therapy.
Hurler-Schele syndrome, caused by a lack of a certain enzyme called
aL-iduronidase, is eventually fatal, but first causes loss of sight, hearing and
speech, as well as swelling of organs such as the heart and lungs.
Mackenzie's parents can't fathom why their boy won't be covered for the
treatment when another child is receiving money from Health Canada for the same
drug to treat a different condition.
"It's not only our son, there are other children out there suffering with this
same disease that are being cut off, if they haven't been cut off already.
When asked if there's anything he'll do to help the boy, Health Minister Ujjal
Dosanjh said he's "not God" and the treatment must be assessed by a common drug
review before the government decides if it's cost-effective to supply.
Mackenzie's treatment, which should be covered by the First Nations Inuit Health
Branch, is just one of several similar therapies caught up in the government's
new drug review process and unavailable to most patients in the interim.
Enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry's disease patients -- called Fabrazyme --
was put through the review in the fall but rejected because it didn't meet
cost-effective standards.
After an outpouring of opposition from patients, the
$300,000 a year treatment was sent for a second review, expected to end in May.

SCIENTISTS at Newcastle University have discovered a way of treating a rare
disease which leads to kidney failure and death in children.
Although there is currently no cure for Joubert Syndrome, the new findings,
published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, mean
that it is now possible to develop a therapy to help those suffering with the
condition.
Joubert syndrome is an inherited developmental disorder affecting the brain,
kidneys and eyes.
Affected children have a range of problems including learning
difficulties, movement problems, loss of eye sight and life-threatening cystic
kidney disease, often leading to total kidney failure by the age of 13.
More than 4,000 people across the UK require renal replacement therapy (dialysis
and transplantation) due to cystic kidney disease.
Dr John Sayer, a kidney specialist at Newcastle University and the Freeman
Hospital, and Dr Colin Miles, a geneticist at the Institute of Genetic Medicine,
Newcastle University, discovered a cell signalling problem which causes cystic
kidney disease in Joubert Syndrome.
"What is crucial here is that we have shown that the kidney damage in these
patients is not permanent and so can potentially be treated," said Dr Sayer.
"In Joubert syndrome, the kidney cells form abnormal cysts, meaning they are
incapable of carrying out their role properly.
Using a new treatment we can
restore this defect."

Costly therapy not covered: 9-year-old has rare disease.
A12

LENGTH: 384  words

DATELINE: OTTAWA


Mackenzie Olsen is just one of dozens of rare-disease patients in Canada who are
left without treatment, and perhaps a future, because the federal government has
no strategy for funding costly but potentially life-saving therapies.
The 9-year-old Alberta boy, who suffers from an unusual genetic disorder called
Hurler-Schele syndrome, must wait until at least July for Ottawa to decide if it
will pay for his $17,000-per-week enzyme replacement therapy.
Hurler-Schele syndrome, caused by a lack of a certain enzyme called
aL-iduronidase, is eventually fatal, but first causes loss of sight, hearing and
speech, as well as swelling of organs such as the heart and lungs.
Mackenzie's parents can't fathom why their boy won't be covered when another
child is receiving money from Health Canada for the same drug to treat a
different condition.
"It's not only our son, there are other children out there suffering with this
same disease that are being cut off, if they haven't been cut off already."
When asked yesterday if there's anything he'll do to help the boy, Health
Minister Ujjal Dosanjh said he's "not God" and the treatment must be assessed by
a common drug review before the government decides if it's cost-effective to
supply.
Mackenzie's treatment, which should be covered by the First Nations Inuit Health
Branch, is just one of several similar therapies caught up in the government's
new drug review process and unavailable to most patients in the interim.

Alcobra Granted European Orphan Drug Designation for Metadoxine in Fragile X
Syndrome

LENGTH: 420  words


July 19 -- Alcobra Ltd. (Nasdaq:ADHD), an emerging pharmaceutical company
focused on the development of new medications to help patients with cognitive
disorders, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Fragile
X Syndrome, today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted Orphan
Drug designation to Metadoxine for the treatment of Fragile X Syndrome within
the European Union.
EC Orphan Drug designation is granted to drugs that are intended for the
treatment of life threatening or chronically debilitating rare diseases where no
satisfactory therapeutic options exist.
In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted orphan drug status
in the United States to Metadoxine for the treatment of Fragile X Syndrome, and
in 2015, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to our proprietary Metadoxine
Extended Release (MDX) for Fragile X Syndrome.
Fast Track designation is a
process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs
that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs in serious or
life-threatening diseases or conditions.
Currently, there are no approved
medications in the United States or Europe for Fragile X Syndrome.
About Fragile X Syndrome

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a genetic condition that causes intellectual
disability, behavioral and learning challenges.
FXS represents an unmet
medical need and a rare disease, as defined by the U.S. Orphan Drug Act.
About MDX

MDX (Metadoxine Extended Release) is a proprietary investigational new drug
candidate being developed by Alcobra for the potential treatment of ADHD and
Fragile X Syndrome.
MDX
is currently in Phase III development for adults with ADHD, Phase II development
for pediatric ADHD, and Phase II development for Fragile X Syndrome.

PUNE: A 15-year old boy suffering rare types of neuromascular and genetic
diseases successfully underwent cardiac surgery at Aditya Birla Memorial
hospital here recently.
"Gyaneshwar was not only suffering from Myasthenia graves which is a
neuromuscular disease that leads to muscle weakness and fatigue but he was also
diagnosed with a very rare disease called Kearns Sayre Syndrome at our hospital.
The prevalence of this syndrome is approximately 1-3 in 1,00,000 people.
It is a
rare neuromuscular disorder, which leads to heart diseases such as heart block,
progressive paralysis of eye muscles and abnormal accumulation of colored
material on nerve rich membrane lining the eyes leading to chronic inflammation,
progressive degeneration and wearing away of certain eye structures," Rajesh
Badani, senior consultant cardiologist and electrophysiologist of Aditya Birla
Memorial Hospital.
On thorough examination in our advanced pediatrician department, it was
diagnosed that he also had another genetic disorder called Kearns Sayre Syndrome
.

Drugs deal for rare disease victims

BYLINE: Matthew Denholm

LENGTH: 150 words


Treatments for rare diseases will be more easily available following a

deal between Australian and United States drug authorities.
The agreement, known as the Drug Orphan Program, will make it cheaper

and easier for drug companies to market drugs for rare illnesses.
Until now, treatments for such illnesses have not been commercially

viable for manufacturers because of the small number of patients.
Under the changes, drug companies will be able to market treatments

without hefty evaluation fees, and studies by the US Food and Drug

Administration will be used to avoid long, costly trials in Australia.
Other rare diseases include Huntington's chorea, Tourette's syndrome,

Osteogenesis imperfecta, Severe Combined Immune Deficiency syndrome,

Filariasis, Wilson's disease and Narcolepsy.

As a father of two young children with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), Paul
Willson wants to be positive about Monday's announcement by Health Minister Eric
Hoskins of an Ontario clinic for EDS.
Willson is wondering and worrying about compensation for families like his that
have racked up huge medical bills for operations and medical treatment in the
United States.
They can't get treatment in Ontario but the Ministry of Health
won't cover treatment out of the province.
Willson and wife Chantelle's children Brodie, 5, and Peyton, 4, both have EDS
and tethered spinal cord syndrome.
It is hard to diagnose and few doctors have
the knowledge to properly treat patients.
Adding to the family's stress, Willson also has EDS and said he thinks he might
have the same tethered cord condition as his children.
The new clinic would help primary-care health providers get information and
guidelines on signs and symptoms, receive feedback from experts on treatment
options, and expedite referrals to specialists.
"The new initiatives our government is pursuing will help people living with
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and other rare diseases access the supports they need so
they can receive the highest quality of care close to home," Hoskins said in a
Toronto Star story.
The mandate of the new clinic could eventually be expanded to help doctors and
nurses treat other rare diseases, he said.
Dr. James Rutka, co-chair of the Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Expert Panel, said "the
establishment of the joint adult and pediatric EDS clinic is a big step forward
in providing multi-disciplinary care and treatment for EDS patients in Ontario."
Brant MPP Dave Levac has been addressing this issue and other rare diseases for
many years and has worked directly with families affected by Ehlers-Danlos
Syndrome in the Brant region.
"I have been pursuing solutions for the health and financial problems faced by
people suffering from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and my heart has gone out to the
families in Brant that have had to brave the world with EDS diagnoses," Levac
said in a statement.

NPS Pharmaceuticals initiates global registration study of Teduglutide in
pediatric patients with short bowel syndrome

SECTION: INSURANCE; Product Developments

LENGTH: 254 words



HIGHLIGHT: NPS Pharmaceuticals, a global biopharmaceutical company pioneering
and delivering therapies that transform the lives of patients with rare diseases
worldwide, announced that the company has initiated a global registration study
of teduglutide in pediatric patients with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) who are
dependent on parenteral support.
"We are particularly proud to advance teduglutide in pediatric Short Bowel
Syndrome, as it may bring us one step closer to fulfilling a significant unmet
need among children across the globe who face a life burdened by this rare
disease," said Roger Garceau, executive vice president and chief medical officer
of NPS Pharmaceuticals.
The four-cohort study is expected to enroll up to 36 patients.
The study will attempt to enroll a fourth cohort of patients in an
observational arm that would receive a current standard of care with parenteral
support and will be considered a safety control group.
All subjects will be screened prior to the start of treatment to establish
baseline characteristics including safety, eligibility and nutritional support
parameters.
After a human development course last year, I remember a friend and I
wondering just how rare "rare" disease was.
Sure, the probability of getting a
specific rare disease is small, but wouldn't the probability of getting any rare
disease be significant?
We also learned that the
majority of embryos/fetuses that have major illnesses like Down syndrome (80 per
cent, a disease that increases risk for heart problems and leukemia) and
Turner's syndrome (99 per cent, a disease that increases risk for heart problems
and infertility) are miscarried.
It is rare for a fetus with a major illness to
be born, since the same major illnesses that cause problems after birth cause
problems before birth as well.
Also interesting are the explanations for the appearance of a medical
condition or a trait in one child and not his sibling.
Diseases or traits that are
passed down through X chromosomes, therefore, are inherited the same way in both
genders like diseases or traits in other chromosomes (the ones both genders
have) are.
Random
mutations sometimes explain why no one in a family has a certain medical
condition or trait except for one person.

This decision will leave Maddi with no chance of survival'

LENGTH: 782  words


A HEARTBROKEN family of a girl with a rare terminal disease have begged the NHS
not to cut funding for potentially life-saving research.
Nine-year-old Maddison Crockford-Reid has such a rare condition - Sanfilippo
syndrome - that there is no cure.
But for the past two years, Maddi has been involved in a clinical trials in
Manchester - at a specialist hospital for Sanfillipo syndrome - for a potential
treatment.
But the NHS and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has
revealed from Saturday, it will no longer pay for the most costly treatments for
people with rare conditions.
Having this funding is a massive glimmer of hope for both our family and
families affected by rare diseases.
It feels as though this tiny glimmer of hope has been snatched away from us

There's not a lot for the family of people with rare diseases to hang on to.'
Whether a treatment is Nice approved or not, does not itself determine who
should have it on the NHS,' Ms Mordaunt said.
If a treatment would help a person they should clearly receive it and it is
highly unethical to withdraw a treatment someone has been receiving.
An issue for rare conditions is that sometimes the specialist healthcare
professionals have not been able to give evidence to Nice because there are so
few of them.
In the UK there are only 24 people affected by Sanfilippo syndrome, with only a
handful having the same ultra-rare version that Maddi has.
This would effectively be leaving the disease to simply "take its course" and
thus leaving her no hope or chance of survival.'
The move will see the introduction of a £100,000 quality-adjusted life year'
threshold for medicines evaluated as part of Nice's technologies programme,
which assesses treatments for ultra-rare diseases.
Campaigners say this threshold would stop the flow of expensive new medicines
reaching patients most desperately in need, with most treatments costing upwards
of £500,000.
Charity leaders claim this is a small price to pay to give the few families in
Britain, coping with ultra-rare illnesses, extra time with their loved ones.
Speaking to The News, Mrs Lavery said: To penalise these families and children
for the misfortune to have these rare diseases is incomprehensible.
Being born with an ultra-rare disease, a disease affecting less than 110 people
in England, is not a lifestyle choice.
It happens very rarely but it happened to my son.
At that time, there was no
treatment and Simon died aged seven years.
I can only imagine now how it might be to be faced with a child with an ultra-
rare disease who could be treated with a  highly-specialised medicine but is
denied treatment on cost grounds.

* About 40 people in the world have Hay-Wells syndrome, which often causes skin
to wear away easily.
Doctors are meeting at St. Louis University this week to
study the disease.
Austin and six other children with a rare
genetic disorder, called Hay-Wells syndrome, gathered at St. Louis University
for the first symposium on their condition.
Like most children born
with Hay-Wells syndrome, Austin's skin wears away easily.
Only about 40 people in the world are known to have Hay-Wells syndrome, said
Jodi Edgar Reinhardt of the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias, the
organization that sponsored the conference.
The foundation brought scientists and doctors together to discuss the skin
erosion that often accompanies the disease - also called
ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defect-cleft lip and/or palate, or AEC - and how to
heal those wounds.
But the lessons scientists and doctors learn from studying people with such rare
genetic problems could shed light on what goes wrong in more common diseases and
lead to better medicine for everyone.
"We are so ignorant still about what is going on in a cell that any knowledge we
gain from a disease is an enormous help," said Anne Bowcock, joint director of
the division of human genetics at Washington University.
Some exceedingly rare diseases are already providing insight into conditions,
such as aging, that are likely to affect every person, she said.
Earlier this
year, scientists working with the Human Genome Project found the gene defect
that leads to Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a disease that causes rapid
aging in children.
Genetic diseases such as Hay-Wells syndrome provide scientists a clearer vision
of the role genes play in development, said Dr. Elaine C. Siegfried, a pediatric
dermatologist at St. Louis University.
Many of the genes that go wrong in these
inherited diseases may also play a role in common, complicated disorders such as
diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and obesity, she said.
But the more
common conditions usually involve multiple genes, and environmental factors
often determine the course of the disease.
The rare diseases, caused by
mutations in single genes, may highlight the role of the gene without the
environmental influence.
Research on Hay-Wells syndrome and related disorders, such as
ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome - known as EEC - already has
revealed surprising functions for a gene once thought to be involved in
suppressing tumor formation.
Denyse Shimchick, 26, of East Alton, doesn't know why she, her two children and
her older sister have the same disease but different problems either.
She brought Dyllan, 5, and Danielle, 4, to the conference so that
researchers could see how the disease sometimes affects members of the same
family differently.
The conference may not lead to cures for Hay-Wells syndrome or better treatments
for burns and other wounds right away, cautioned some experts.
"Understanding genetics in general hasn't led to treatments, but that doesn't
mean that it won't," Bowcock said.

condition that affects muscles controlling facial expressions and eye-control.
The organisation receives £5,000 to raise awareness of rare diseases and
syndromes by developing high-quality profiles and case studies of members and
their families who live with rare conditions.
Speaking about her family's experience with coping with Isaac's condition,
Ceridwen said: "When Isaac was initially diagnosed our whole life was turned
upside down.
"Whilst this was a really hard time it is the relentless need to explain his
condition over and again that has been the hardest.
"Because Isaac's condition affects him facially we often feel a need to explain
what it is and how it affects him so they do not make assumptions.
"Some people cannot see past the condition and this is very frustrating.
"For children like Isaac and their families, making people more aware that
whilst they have rare conditions they are still people who have feelings and
being able to live without fear that people are staring at, and judging you is
essential."

Tot's life hangs on marrow transplant: Despite odds, rare disease threatens
second baby in same London family

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.
After Greg and Jackie Kaminski lost their first son to a rare genetic disease,
they were told the odds of having another with the same syndrome were about the
same as their chances of winning the lottery.
The Kaminskis' first-born son Justin was just 6 1/2 months old when he died of
severe combined immune deficiency syndrome -- known as SCIDS -- in 1989 when
they lived in Saskatchewan.
SECOND SON

Seven years later, their second son, seven-month-old Mitchell, is fighting the
same disease in Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children after a potentially
life-saving bone marrow transplant in January.
Mitchell Kaminski and a Barrie-area child are currently the only two SCIDS
patients at the Hospital for Sick Children, where most children stricken with
the rare disease are sent.
And while he says the illness is rare, "we don't
know how rare because there are probably quite a few kids who are missed."
He says SCIDS patients are born with a deficient immune system.
Researchers are now trying
to identify the genetic mutation that causes the condition in hopes of one day
treating it with gene therapy.

A supporting role

Christie discovered her daughter, Mindy, actually had a rare genetic disorder
called Cri du Chat.
Doctors can often diagnose the condition on hearing the distinctive cry, before
even doing a blood test to check the chromosomes.
The ability to link nationally and internationally has created some powerful,
political lobby groups such as NORD, the US National Organisation for Rare
Diseases.
Rare diseases, often known as "orphan" diseases, are defined as conditions that
affect fewer than 1 in 200,000 people.
Continued Page 2

From Page 1

There are 6000 recognised rare diseases including Tay-Sachs disease, hemophilia,
and other more obscure diseases, such as Tyrosinemia and Canavan disease, which
affect only a few hundred people worldwide.
Pharmaceutical companies traditionally have shown little interest in funding
research to develop treatments for rare diseases.
These support groups realised that, although the incidence of each disease was
small, together 25 million Americans suffered from one of these 6000 rare
diseases.
Working as a unified group, they lobbied the US Congress to create legislation
called the Orphan Drug Act, which provided incentives for the development of
treatments for rare disorders.
According to the NORD website, in the decade
before the Orphan Drug Act was enacted, only 10 new treatments for orphan
diseases were developed.
In the 20 years since it was passed, more than 200 new treatments for rare
disorders have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and an
additional 900 are in various stages of development.
More recently NORD has been able to pressure US President George Bush to pass
legislation doubling the budget for research into rare diseases.
The same is true for many support groups in Australia, which are realising their
potential to lobby to improve awareness and increase funding for unknown
diseases.
Thus, when Stephen and Kathy Russell began the VCFS support group in 1987 after
their daughter was diagnosed with Velo Cardio Facial Syndrome (also called
Shprintzen's Syndrome) they had no idea how it would change their lives.
He realised
that a cluster of symptoms he saw in his patients, such as cleft palate, cardiac
problems, learning difficulties and behavioural problems -- as well as up to 183
other possible signs -- were the result of 25 genes missing from the 22
chromosome.
The way the child is affected by this syndrome depends on exactly which genes
are involved.
VCFS is interesting because it is a relatively recently recognised syndrome.
Although it is second only to Down syndrome as the most common human genetic
disorder, and one of the leading causes of birth defects in Australia, it is
relatively unknown in the community.
Last year the foundation brought world VCFS experts, including the syndrome's
namesake Professor Shprintzen to Brisbane for an international conference.
Doctors, nurses and families gathered to discuss the latest ideas about
management of the condition.
Families living with children suffering from conditions like VCFS and Cri du
Chat are often under tremendous stress.
Professor David Sillence from the Clinical Genetics Department at The Children's
Hospital, Westmead, says internet support groups have made a difference to the
lives of many of his patients.
"Some of these children have extremely rare conditions which affect less than
one in a million people.
They are very unlikely to meet someone else with the
condition locally.
There is even an internet support group for those people whose syndromes have no
diagnosis.
The "syndromes without a name" website (www.undiagnosed.clara.net) was set up to
provide information and support and ultimately to gather a database of
information to establish links between cases to help with diagnosis.
Where
conditions are very rare, and information is sparse, people from all over the
world can share their experiences and knowledge about living with the condition.
The doctor had never had a patient with Cri du Chat and she told Gorry there was
only one paragraph in her medical textbook about the condition.

When an orphan drug is a patient's only hope;
Canada lacks a policy to treat rare - or orphan - diseases, but a motion today
in Parliament seeks to change that

When Szymon Cajmer was six years old, he was denied entry into a clinical trial
to test the only drug to treat his rare disease because his lungs worked too
well.
The drug he did not qualify to receive years ago - idursulfase - has since been
approved by Health Canada to treat his disease, called Hunter syndrome.
So he continues to deteriorate, with spleen and liver enlargement, carpal tunnel
syndrome, damaged heart valves.
"Because it's a progressive disease, it [the drug] is the only hope for
us to pursue."
Canada's lack of an orphan drug policy - to treat orphan, or rare, diseases -
and the unequal access to medications for these diseases is what North Vancouver
Liberal MP Don Bell is hoping to change when he introduces a private member's
motion today in the House of Commons.
The motion seeks a definition for rare disorders, the possible creation of a
fund to improve access to rare-disease treatments and the consideration of
options to encourage research and development.
Orphan drugs are exorbitantly expensive, largely because of the small numbers of
patients who require them.
Yet society is faced with this question: Can a drug, perhaps the only primary
treatment, be denied to patients if it can help?
Without a new standard, drugs for rare diseases are far less likely to be
approved for provincial government funding.
Durhane Wong-Rieger, president of the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders,
described today's motion as a "huge step."
Though the U.S. policy does not necessarily provide access to rare drugs, it has
been successful in providing incentives to pharmaceutical companies to find
treatments for rare diseases.
A national advisory
group aims to help health-care providers by assuring a cash flow to support rare
and expensive treatments.
The drug Szymon requires is funded in Britain; about 45 patients are on it,
according to Ed Wraith, consultant pediatrician at Royal Manchester Children's
Hospital.
Though Elaprase does not cure Hunter syndrome, a progressive disease, it has
been shown to improve some outcomes in patients, such as lengthening walking
distance.
Joe Clarke, senior associate scientist in the Hospital for Sick Children's
Research Institute, who treats Szymon, said some patients feel better on the
drug and have shown improvement in long-standing complications, such as better
airways, joint mobility and energy.
Szymon, who lives in Tecumseh, east of Windsor, would be "an ideal candidate for
enzyme replacement therapy if enzyme replacement therapy was demonstrated as
effective as we hope it is," Dr. Clarke said of the treatment, in a telephone
interview.
"Most of us, and that includes any government official I've been involved with,
want very desperately to find a way to help patients in a way that is fair and
effective," said Dr. Clarke, who is also a clinical professor in the University
of Sherbrooke's faculty of medicine.
Mr. Yoannou wrote in an e-mail that the government has limited public funds to
pay for all treatments and "decisions are made based on clinically relevant
evidence.
Laurel Ostfield, press secretary to Ontario Health Minister George Smitherman,
said the ministry is developing a new and innovative approach to how drugs for
rare diseases are reviewed.
"These are degenerative diseases, patients are deteriorating slowly every day,"
said Mr. McCabe, noting that the disease is so rare only 20 Canadian patients
would be eligible to take the drug.
The disease, known medically as mucopolysaccharidosis II, occurs when the
breakdown of a chemical widely distributed in the body outside of cells is
defective.
And
like every child, he has dreams of what he wants to do when he grows up, though
even his dream - repairing hearing aids for children - is coloured by his
disease.

Rare diseases not easy for most doctors to diagnose

BYLINE: By Suzanne Bohan, STAFF WRITER

SECTION: TRI-VALLEY

LENGTH: 1103 words


Medical students commonly hear the phrase, "If you hear hoof beats, think
horses, not zebras."
The adage reflects a core tenet of the art of medical diagnoses: It's more
productive to first assume common diseases are the cause of most patients'
symptoms, rather than exotic disorders.
That medical mindset was evident when Kaycee Antosiak, a vivacious 12-year-old
Los Altos girl, sought treatment for her crippling pain after a dog bite.
Three months after the dog attack, she was referred to a Stanford University
physician, Dr. Elliot Krane, who correctly diagnosed her as afflicted with a
rare genetically linked disease called complex regional pain syndrome.
The
condition causes excruciating chronic pain, long after the generally minor
injury that triggered it healed.
"These patients think their foot is immersed in boiling water all of the time,"
said Krane, a pediatric anesthesiologist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital,
who last week at Stanford led the first conference worldwide to seek faster
diagnoses and better treatment of the condition.
With the extraordinary challenge of diagnosing these uncommon conditions, and
medical training that encourages doctors to focus on familiar causes of disease,
most patients with rare disorders run through a gauntlet of doctors before --
for the lucky ones -- they end up referred to the unique physician with the
knowledge to correctly pinpoint their disorder.
Krane recognized
within minutes the disease afflicting Kaycee when he first saw her in November
2005 and immediately started her on treatment.
Occasionally, she said, her
ankle still aches and she's aware she's vulnerable for life from the condition,
absent the development of a treatment that permanently ends the pain.
Kaycee and others with complex regional pain syndrome are among the ranks of the
30 million Americans suffering from one of the nearly 7,000 known rare diseases,
according to Dr. Steven Groft, director of the Office of Rare Diseases with the
National Institutes of Health.
The NIH defines a rare disease as one affecting 200,000 or fewer Americans.
The prevalence of those living with these unusual conditions numerically rivals
the 40 million Americans with one or more of the three major diseases: heart
disease, cancer or diabetes.
The number of patients identified with a rare disease also is expected to swell
with expanding knowledge of the human genome, said Groft.
Rare diseases are
usually attributed to genetics.
"What we're finding is that as more information becomes available, there are
more and more patients who have the rare disorder," Groft said.
And physicians committed to researching and providing treating for one of these
strange maladies often push into medical frontiers to improve the lives of their
patients.
The Stanford conference on complex regional pain syndrome, held May 30 and 31,
drew dozens of experts from a variety of disciplines.
The conference yielded a
consensus paper on better diagnoses and optimal treatment for the condition,
which emphasizes physical therapy with the use of pain medications to ease the
initial agony of exercise, the same therapy Krane used with Kaycee.
These kinds of conferences are vital for improving the medical profession's
track record for diagnosing unique diseases, said Groft.
And even though doctors
often have few if any treatments to offer, the diagnosis allows patients and
their families to band with others with the condition to seek the best
treatments and advocate for research.
"Many advocacy groups can help patients live a little better life," said Groft.
Furthermore, the NIH budget for rare disease research is robust, he added.
Of the $29 billion awarded by the NIH last year for medical research grants, $4
billion, or

18 percent, went to studying rare diseases.
The grants often fund clinical
trials that give patients with few or no options a chance to try potential
treatments, Groft emphasized.
So there
can be hope for people with rare diseases."
Donna Antosiak calls Krane "my favorite person in the whole wide world," while
Kaycee said she doubts she would be walking today without his treatment.

Neurotrope Receives FDA Orphan Drug Designation for Bryostatin in Treatment of
Fragile X Syndrome

LENGTH: 428  words


April 9 -- Neurotrope, Inc. (OTCQB: NTRP) today announced that Neurotrope
BioScience, Inc., its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, (the "Company") has
been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for its lead proprietary drug candidate, bryostatin, in the treatment of
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS).
Bryostatin is a potent activator of Protein Kinase C (PKC), which the Company
believes is a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of Fragile X
Syndrome.Neurotrope is developing bryostatin under a licensing agreement with
the Blanchette Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute (BRNI).
"We are pleased to have received orphan drug designation for bryostatin for the
treatment of FXS which represents an area of significant unmet need for patients
and families who live with the consequences of this genetic disorder," said
Charles S. Ramat, President and Chief Executive Officer of Neurotrope, Inc. "One
of the key strategies for our Company's future is the licensing of novel
therapeutics to develop treatments for orphan diseases such as FXS.
In keeping
with this strategic imperative, we have also initiated preclinical work with
bryostatin for the treatment of Niemann-Pick type C, a rare devastating genetic
disorder in children.As we progress our clinical development programs for
Fragile X and NPC we continue to work towards building a robust portfolio of
drug development candidates in orphan disease indications."
Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA Office of Orphan Products
Development (OOPD) to novel drugs or biologics that treat a rare disease or
condition affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S.
The OOPD also
works on rare disease issues with the medical and research communities,
professional organizations, academia, governmental agencies, industry, and rare
disease patient groups.
Also commenting on the announcement, Dr. Daniel Alkon, Scientific Director of
BRNI and Chief Scientific Officer of Neurotrope BioScience, Inc., stated, "We
are very encouraged by the pre-clinical data we acquired in a Fragile X mouse
study that suggests treatment with bryostatin can mature synapses and increase
the number of synaptic connections resulting in improved learning and memory."

Charles S. Ramat, President and Chief Executive Officer of Neurotrope, Inc. "One
of the key strategies for our Company's future is the licensing of novel
therapeutics to develop treatments for orphan diseases such as FXS.
In keeping
with this strategic imperative, we have also initiated preclinical work with
bryostatin for the treatment of Niemann-Pick type C, a rare devastating genetic
disorder in children.As we progress our clinical development programs for
Fragile X and NPC we continue to work towards building a robust portfolio of
drug development candidates in orphan disease indications."
Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA Office of Orphan Products
Development (OOPD) to novel drugs or biologics that treat a rare disease or
condition affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S.
The OOPD also
works on rare disease issues with the medical and research communities,
professional organizations, academia, governmental agencies, industry, and rare
disease patient groups.
Also commenting on the announcement, Dr. Daniel Alkon, Scientific Director of
BRNI and Chief Scientific Officer of Neurotrope BioScience, Inc., stated, "We
are very encouraged by the pre-clinical data we acquired in a Fragile X mouse
study that suggests treatment with bryostatin can mature synapses and increase
the number of synaptic connections resulting in improved learning and memory."

Only twenty people in the world have this disease and Matilda is one of them;
Sensenbrenner Syndrome means Walsall girl grows at a slower rate than other
children

A Black Country girl who is one of an estimated 20 people in the WORLD to suffer
from a rare disease has become the face of a hospital fundraising campaign.
Matilda Hatton, aged seven, from Walsall, has Sensenbrenner Syndrome, but she
wasn't diagnosed until she was three years old because doctors were baffled by
her symptoms.
The disease means she has morphic facial features, shorter limbs and grows at a
slower rate than other children.
Little is known about the condition.
Days after Matilda was born she was rushed from Stafford Hospital to Birmingham
Children's Hospital, where she has received treatment and has been monitored
ever since.
It was there that doctors finally told Les and Michelle that they believed their
daughter had Sensenbrenner Syndrome.
Michelle added: "A woman from Canada messaged us one evening to say her child
also had Sensenbrenner Syndrome.
She puts up a front fighting off any tiredness she gets from the
condition.
Now Matilda is part of the Star Appeal by Birmingham Children's Hospital, which
is aiming to raise £3.65 million to fund a rare diseases centre at the site.
Every day is precious'

Her picture will go up in Victoria Square along with 11 other youngsters who are
also suffering from a wide range of uncommon conditions next month as part of a
fundraising exhibition.
For Matilda's family a new Rare Diseases Centre would be incredible.

Leeds MP's debate to help little Sam

LENGTH: 294  words


The plight of an Otley schoolboy with an incurable disease will be discussed in
the House of Commons next week when MPs debate the issue of access to drugs for
ultra-rare diseases.
The 180 people referred to have ultra-rare diseases Morquio Syndrome, Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.
They include six year-old Sam Brown, who has the degenerative condition Morquio
Syndrome, which limits growth and mobility and shortens life expectancy to an
average age of 25.
If the decision goes not go as campaigners hope, Sam will cease to receive the
drug and his condition will worsen.
While there is no cure for Sam's condition, trials have shown Vimizim can slow
its progression.
She said the drug had significantly improved her son's
condition.

ArQule, National Human Genome Research Institute of National Institutes of
Health Announce Enrollment of First Patient in Phase 1 Proteus Syndrome Trial
with ARQ 092

LENGTH: 510  words


Nov. 17 -- ArQule, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARQL) and the National Human Genome Research
Institute (NHGRI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) today announced
enrollment of the first patient in the phase 1 clinical trial for Proteus
syndrome.
This trial, with ARQ 092, an orally available, selective pan-AKT
inhibitor, marks the first clinical trial in this rare disease.
Proteus syndrome
is characterized by overgrowth of the skeleton, skin, adipose tissue and central
nervous system.
Additionally, ArQule received orphan drug designation from the Federal Drug
Administration (FDA) for ARQ 092 in Proteus syndrome.
Proteus syndrome impacts fewer than one in a million people worldwide.
In 2011, an NHGRI team led by Dr. Leslie G. Biesecker discovered that the
somatic single (point) mutation in the AKT1 oncogene causes Proteus syndrome1.
Subsequently the NHGRI team presented at the 2014 meeting of the American
Society of Human Genetics (ASHG, Abstract # 2180M2) data that demonstrate that
treatment with ARQ 092 caused a rapid shutdown of AKT signaling and a reduction
in the viability of Proteus syndrome cells taken from patients compared to
untreated diseased cells.
These findings provided pre-clinical proof-of-concept
for advancement of ARQ 092 into clinical testing for Proteus syndrome.
"The collaboration with ArQule has provided an opportunity to initiate a phase 1
trial to investigate the therapeutic impact of ARQ 092 in a rare, genetic
disorder that has no approved therapy and for which the only current treatment
is surgery," said Dr. Leslie G. Biesecker, M.D., Chief of the Medical Genomics
and Metabolic Genetics Branch at the National Human Genome Research Institute.
"The goal of the trial is to identify a safe and effective dose to treat Proteus
syndrome patients soon after diagnosis.
It is hoped the drug, if shown to be
safe and effective and approved by the FDA to treat Proteus syndrome in the
future, could potentially be administered over many years in order to mitigate
the abnormal cell signaling initiated by the point mutation."
"We are excited to continue our collaboration with Dr. Biesecker and the NHGRI
team on the first therapeutic drug clinical trial launched for Proteus syndrome
," said Brian Schwartz, M.D., Head of Research and Development and Chief Medical
Officer at ArQule.
"Proteus syndrome is the first rare disease indication to
enter phase 1 for ARQ 092, and we are pleased to have received orphan drug
designation from the FDA.
We are also making progress with ARQ 092 in oncology
where we have observed five partial responses in the phase 1b trial in patients
harboring AKT1/PI3K mutations.
We hope Proteus syndrome patients, with the same
mutation, will achieve comparable clinical benefit once a therapeutic dose is
established."
The phase 1 trial for ARQ 092 in Proteus syndrome, being conducted by the NHGRI,
is a biodynamic dose finding study.

Two do best to help sick four-year-old
 By
 TWO East London doctors have come to the aid of a four-year-old boy who suffers
from a rare disease which causes his hands to grow out of proportion to his
body.
Born in Alice in 2008, the boy suffers from Proteus syndrome, also known as
Wiedemann syndrome.
"His condition is not getting any better as they had predicted," she said.
The Daily Dispatch reported on the child's condition last Thursday and Dr
Nonkosi Ngumbela from Alice was moved by the story.
Crowther told the
family that Frere doctors were correct, and that the boy's condition was rare,
which made it difficult for them to do anything for him.
Crowther said in some cases, Proteus syndrome affected the legs and spine,
making it hard for the patient to walk, but the boy was fortunate as this was
not the case with him.

NIH leverages facial recognition software to diagnose rare genetic diseases

BYLINE: Greg Slabodkin

SECTION: Vol.

LENGTH: 616  words


The global fight against rare genetic diseases has a new tool in its arsenal for
early diagnoses of these dreaded conditions-facial recognition software.
Researchers at the National Human Genome Research Institute have successfully
leveraged the software to help diagnose DiGeorge syndrome, a rare genetic
disease that afflicts African, Asian and Latin American children.
The technology
has also been used for diagnosing Down syndrome.
According to Maximilian Muenke, MD, chief of the Medical Genetics Branch at
NHGRI, facial features are crucial to the diagnosis of such diseases.
However,
Muenke contends that the appearance of individuals with the diseases can vary
widely in diverse populations, making it difficult for clinicians to diagnose.
However, Muenke's colleague Marius George Linguraru, an investigator at the
Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation at Children's National
Health System in Washington, developed facial recognition software that is very
accurate in diagnosing DiGeorge syndrome and Down syndrome using photographs of
patients from different ethnic groups.
Results of astudy, published last week in the American Journal of Medical
Genetics by Muenke and his colleagues, showed that researchers using the facial
recognition software made correct diagnoses more than 96 percent of the time for
DiGeorge syndrome-also known as velocardiofacial syndrome, which can cause heart
defects, poor immune system function, a cleft palate, and low levels of calcium
in the blood.

The effort is part of NHGRI's Atlas of Human Malformations in Diverse
Populations, a website launched last September to serve as an online resource
for clinicians looking to diagnose different inherited diseases through
photographs of people with syndromic disorders and the molecular diagnoses
gathered from around the world, including Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the
Middle East, South America and sub-Saharan Africa.
Muenke, who is co-creator of the atlas, notes that the only previously available
diagnostic atlas featured photos of patients of northern European descent, which
was very limiting in terms of geographic value.
"Human malformation syndromes appear different in different parts of the world,"
said Paul Kruszka, MD, a medical geneticist in NHGRI's Medical Genetics Branch.
"Even experienced clinicians have difficulty diagnosing genetic syndromes in
non-European populations."
DiGeorge syndrome and Down syndrome have now been added to the electronic atlas,
which shows the pattern of malformations that are consistent with these
syndromes, according to Muenke.
Providers with limited resources or access to
genetic specialists are able to use the atlas and the facial recognition
software for early diagnoses of these rare diseases that often go undiagnosed,
he says.
"We take photos of every syndrome that we can get our hands on," Muenke adds.
Going forward, Muenke says researchers plan to study Noonan syndrome and
Williams syndrome, which are also rare genetic disorders.

April 02--ASHLAND -- Amanda Wesolowski used the term "lifeless" to describe the
condition of her son when he was just 4 months old.
Ian, who is almost 2 years old now, was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder
called Bartter syndrome that currently has no cure.
This means the patients lose excessive amounts of salt.
Dixon also touched on the rarity of Bartter syndrome.
In order to be born with Bartter syndrome, someone must inherit one defective
copy of the gene from their mother and one defective copy of the gene from their
father.
Wesolowski said she leans on her faith and family to help her through the trials
Bartter syndrome has presented.
Wesolowski added she is also a part of an online community with those affected
by the syndrome.

Doctors are using a smartphone app that can scan photos for the facial
characteristics of more than 2,000 genetic syndromes within seconds.
The Face2Gene app is being introduced at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, to help
in the diagnosis of children with rare conditions.
Its deep-learning algorithm analyses the shape of the face and position of the
eyes, ears, nose and lips, comparing the data with a reference database to list
any genetic conditions that could fit the measurements.
In many cases the genes
responsible give patients a distinctive look.
Dekel Gelbman, chief executive of FDNA, the app's creators, said: "We're talking
about rare syndromes such as Williams syndrome, which is characterised by
learning difficulties and cardiovascular problems.
Individually these conditions are rare, but collectively they're common.
One in
ten people has a 'rare' disease."
"At the moment parents in the US often wait over
seven years for a diagnosis for a child with a rare syndrome, and in Brit-ain
it's about five years," Mr Gelbman said.
The more children are diagnosed, the more likely it is that treatments will be
developed."
Once a face has been analysed from one straight-on photograph, the app will list
any syndromes that could be associated with those features.
Scientists including Peter Hammond, of Oxford University, have been working on
using artificial intelligence to analyse the facial features characteristic of
genetic conditions for many years, making rapid progress.
The US National Institute of Health has developed an algorithm that identified
Down's syndrome in 94 per cent of cases in trials.

A MUM-OF-FIVE is hoping to raise awareness of the rare disease her daughter is
suffering from by holding a four-day conference in Birmingham.
Michelle Peel, 37, of Chelmsley Wood, was told by medics Evie-Anne, then only
nine months old, had the littleknown 1p36 Deletion Syndrome.
Those with the syndrome have lost a small but variable
amount of genetic material from one of their 46 chromosomes.
She added: "I thought it was a genetic condition and pushed this further with
the hospital.
"There is so little known about the syndrome that there could be other sufferers
out there.
"If there is anyone out there who has children diagnosed with the condition,
they are urged to come along or get in contact with me."
For more information about the conference, email Michelle at markpeel@gmail.com

disease called 1P36 Deletion Syndrome.
It's called Sturge-Weber syndrome.
And it prompted DeCesaris to bicycle across
the country to raise money and spread awareness of his niece's syndrome.
To a 9-year-old girl, the syndrome means seizures one Christmas morning and a
breakfast of oatmeal and nine pills.
Faneca's
daughter also suffers from the syndrome, said Ida Heck, Jenna's mother.
"A lot of people just don't know about (Sturge-Weber syndrome)," he told them.
About one in 20,000 children are born with the syndrome, according to the
Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore.
Researchers there recently identified the mutation that causes the syndrome.
DeCesaris told the fourth-graders about his niece's syndrome.
He will arrive Tuesday in Ocean City, ending a journey that's
raised at least $25,000 for research into Sturge-Weber syndrome, a rare disease
that one student at the school suffers from.
Jenna has Sturge-Weber syndrome, a congenital
neurological disorder, and a port-wine birthmark on her face, a telltale sign of
the syndrome.
DeCesaris spent more than 40 days bicycling
across the country to raise money for research into a rare disease that afflicts
his niece, who is in fourth grade at the school.

MEDICS plunged a Midland mum into a six-week coma to save her from a rare
disease.
Juliet Baron, from Alvechurch, Worcestershire, was left temporarily paralysed
after her treatment to save her from the potentially fatal Guillain-Barre
syndrome.
While in a coma she was treated for double pneumonia and adult respiratory
distress syndrome, which meant both her lungs collapsed.
When I talked
to him, he mentioned Guillain-Barre syndrome but passed it off as 'a virus'.
But two days later Juliet said she became delirious and she was rushed to
Alexandra Hospital, in Redditch, where medics quickly diagnosed the potentially
fatal syndrome.
The disease sends the immune system into overdrive which then
attacks the nervous system.
Once the condition was identified Juliet was transferred to the High Dependency
Unit at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and as her state got worse, to critical care
in the Neurosciences Department.
But despite being over the worst of the condition Juliet was far from fully fit.

Rare diseases not simple for most docs to diagnose

BYLINE: By Suzanne Bohan, STAFF WRITER

SECTION: REVIEW

LENGTH: 1237 words


Medical students commonly hear the phrase, "If you hear hoof beats, think
horses, not zebras."
The adage reflects a core tenet of the art of medical diagnoses: It's more
productive to first assume common diseases are the cause of most patients'
symptoms, rather than exotic disorders.
That medical mindset was evident when Kaycee Antosiak, a vivacious 12-year-old
Los Altos girl, sought treatment for her crippling pain after a dog bite.
Three months after the dog attack, she was referred to a Stanford University
physician, Dr. Elliot Krane, who correctly diagnosed her as afflicted with a
rare genetic disease called complex regional pain syndrome.
The condition causes
excruciating chronic pain, long after the generally minor injury that triggered
it healed.
"These patients think their foot is immersed in boiling water all of the time,"
said Krane, a pediatric anesthesiologist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital,
who last week at Stanford led the first conference worldwide to seek faster
diagnoses and better treatment of the condition.
With the extraordinary challenge of diagnosing these uncommon conditions, and
medical training that encourages doctors to focus on familiar causes of disease,
most patients with rare disorders run through a gauntlet of doctors before --
for the lucky ones -- they end up referred to the unique physician with the
knowledge to correctly pinpoint their disorder.
Krane recognized
within minutes the disease afflicting Kaycee when he first saw her in November
2005 and immediately started her on treatment.
Occasionally, she said, her
ankle still aches and she's aware she's vulnerable for life from the condition,
absent the development of a treatment that permanently ends the pain.
While only a few hundred other Americans suffer from the condition, Kaycee and
others with complex regional pain syndrome are among the ranks of the 30 million
Americans suffering from one of the nearly

7,000 known rare diseases, according to Dr. Steven Groft, director of the Office
of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.
The NIH defines a rare disease as one affecting 200,000 or fewer Americans.
They carry strange names like Madelung's disease, which causes abnormal fat
accumulation around the neck and shoulders; Kufs disease, a neurological
disorder that mimics a mental illness; or the horrific fibrodysplasia ossificans
progressive, which causes muscle tissue and ligaments to turn to bone, encasing
the afflicted in bone.
The prevalence of those living with these unusual conditions numerically rivals
the 40 million Americans with one or more of the three major diseases: heart
disease, cancer or diabetes.
The number of patients identified with a rare disease also is expected to swell
with expanding knowledge of the human genome, said Groft.
Rare diseases are
usually attributed to genetics.
"What we're finding is that as more information becomes available, there are
more and more patients who have the rare disorder," Groft said.
And physicians committed to researching and providing treating for one of these
strange maladies often push into medical frontiers to improve the lives of their
patients.
The Stanford conference on complex regional pain syndrome, held May 30 and May
31, drew dozens of experts from a variety of disciplines.
The conference yielded
a consensus paper on better diagnoses and optimal treatment for the condition,
which emphasizes physical therapy with the use of pain medications to ease the
initial agony of exercise, the same therapy Krane used with Kaycee.
These kinds of conferences are vital for improving the medical profession's
track record for diagnosing unique diseases, said Groft.
And even though doctors
often have few if any treatments to offer, the diagnosis allows patients and
their families to band with others with the condition to seek the best
treatments and advocate for research.
"Many advocacy groups can help patients live a little better life," said Groft.
Furthermore, the NIH budget for rare disease research is robust, he added.
Of
the $29 billion awarded by the NIH last year for medical research grants, $4
billion, or 18 percent, went to studying rare diseases.
The grants often fund
clinical trials that give patients with few or no options a chance to try
potential treatments, Groft emphasized.
So there
can be hope for people with rare diseases."
Krane pointed hopefully to a future in which genetic tests of blood samples will
quickly provide answers to the questions that now vex physicians encountering
patients with mysterious ailments.
Until and if such swift diagnoses of rare diseases come to pass, Groft said
those with disorders that defy treatment can best cope with their frustration
and fear by seeking access to specialists.
"No one can be expected to know that many disorders," he said of the rare
diseases so far identified.
"We encourage patients to be referred upward in the
medical system to specialists."
Donna Antosiak calls Krane "my favorite person in the whole wide world," while
Kaycee said she doubts she would be walking today without his treatment.

Beau, who has a rare disease called Morquio A Syndrome, was accompanied by his
mum Sam.
Mr Taylor said Morquio A Syndrome was part of a group of disorders known as
Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs), which impacts the body's ability to produce an
enzyme to break down waste products.
The event at Parliament House was to raise awareness and support of rare
diseases in the lead up to International Rare Disease Day, on Monday 29
February.
People afflicted with rare diseases are going through the same
thing.
It is especially hard for them because they have to go through various medical
examinations and in some cases, serve as a guinea pig to indentify the exact
disease that is plaguing their lives.
A rare disease also referred to as an orphan disease is any disease that affects
a small percentage of the population.
Some orphan diseases are ignored, such as in
unique cases of Malaria, because they are considered to be far more prevalent in
developing countries.
People suffering from rare diseases, often endure harsh
treatments due to insufficient resources, which is why public awareness and
support is important.
Recent data from the World Health Organization show that there are 7,000 known
rare diseases, 50 percent to 70 percent of which affect children, while 30
percent of patients die before they reach the age of five.
According to the Philippine Society for Orphan Disorders (PSOD), a group of
medical professionals from the Institute of Human Genetics, the prevalence of
rare diseases in the country is 1:20,000, with 227 patient families in the PSOD
registry representing 48 rare disorders as of 2014.
The online charity campaign was created to raise
awareness and financial funding for ALS, which stands for Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis, a rare condition, which assaults ones neurons and eventually leads to
paralysis.
Overwhelming support for the campaign has brought to light the disease.
Unfortunately there are still quite a few rare diseases that have yet to make it
to the publics collective consciousness.
Here are some of the rare diseases in the country:

Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome (BRBNS)

It is characterized by numerous malformations of the venous system that
significantly involves the skin and visceral organs.
Blood transfusion is expensive and
this is usually the case with other orphan diseases, as well.
The medical
expenses are financially draining, which is why Ziv and her family rely from the
government for the treatment.
Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD)

AffectING 126 Filipinos as of 2014, most of which were infants, MSUD is the top
orphan disease in the country based on the data by the PSOD.
The condition gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants
urine and is also characterized by poor feeding, vomiting, lack of energy
(lethargy) and developmental delay.
If untreated, maple syrup urine disease can lead to seizures, coma, and death.
Maple syrup urine disease is often classified by its pattern of signs and
symptoms.
The most common and severe form of the disease is the classic type,
which becomes apparent soon after birth.
Also known as Hunter syndrome, it is a condition that affects many different
parts of the body and occurs almost exclusively in males.
Filipino patients with Hunter syndrome exhibit the
characteristic multiorgan involvement seen in most patients with the disorder,
thus, their management requires a multidisciplinary approach.
Galactosemia

It is an orphan disease, which affects newborn babies and currently affects 12
in the country.
The orphan disease elevates blood
galactose levels.
Nonetheless, long-term
complications from galactosemia can still occur despite early diagnosis and
treatment.
Thus, regular monitoring and evaluation are necessary for this is a rare defect
that manifests only by the development of cataracts, usually in the neonatal
period, but occasionally delayed until adulthood.
By doing your part in
raising awareness for these orphan diseases, you are changing someone elses
life.
2098, or the "Rare Disease Act of 2014,(EURO)Â³ which calls
on the government to make sure that persons with rare disease would be given
access to proper medical treatment and medication, on its way.
Filipinos
afflicted with rare diseases should be assured that this is a battle which they
can win.

Pfizer Deal Signals a Move Into Treating Rare Diseases

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg.
Pfizer said Tuesday that it had licensed the worldwide rights to a treatment for
Gaucher disease, a rare genetic disorder, from Protalix Biotherapeutics, an
Israeli biotechnology company.
The deal signals the start of an effort by Pfizer to enter the business of
selling ultra-expensive drugs for ultra-rare diseases, a market that big
pharmaceutical companies once largely ignored.
And the move will put the company into direct competition with Genzyme, the
biotechnology company that already sells a drug called Cerezyme to treat Gaucher
disease.
Big pharmaceutical companies once tended to disregard rare diseases, preferring
to develop blockbusters for common ailments like diabetes and high cholesterol.
''This is the first step in the pursuit of a formal strategy around orphan drugs
and rare diseases,'' David Simmons, president of Pfizer's established products
business unit, said in an interview.
While there might be few patients with each disease, he said, ''collectively,
it's a very large patient population with a great unmet medical need.''
Besides, Genzyme has proved that even a drug for a rare disease can generate big
sales if the price of the drug is high enough.
Pfizer is not alone in pursuing treatments for rare diseases.
And in June, Novartis won approval from
the Food and Drug Administration to sell its drug Ilaris as a treatment for
cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome.
Only about 300 Americans suffer from
that syndrome, an inflammatory condition caused by a gene mutation.
The main concern is that because it is produced in
plant cells, taliglucerase may spur immune reactions in some patients.
The shortfall left Genzyme vulnerable to Protalix and also to Shire, a British
drug company that is also developing a drug for Gaucher disease.
Because of the
shortage, the Food and Drug Administration has been allowing some patients to
use the Shire and Protalix drugs even though they have not been approved.
Gaucher disease is an enzyme deficiency that can cause an enlarged liver and
spleen, anemia, frequent bleeding and bone weakness.
All three drugs consist of
the enzyme that people with Gaucher disease are missing.

A little girl from Northern Ireland has become one of the most operated on in
the UK after undergoing more than 30 procedures.
Jessica Philpott, from Ballymena, Co Antrim, is just six-years-old but faces
many more operations to help her rectify the effects of a rare disease called
Apert syndrome.
Apert syndrome affects fifteen people in every million and in Jessica, a P2
pupil at Buick Memorial Primary School in the town, it means she was born with a
protruding forehead, low set ears, fused fingers and toes, cleft palate and
drooping eyes.

Learning to live with the pain of infertility;
Today is Rare Disease Awareness Day, which highlights the 170,000 people across
Wales whose lives have been affected by unusual medical conditions.
Clare, 45, was born without ovaries as a result of the ultra-rare condition
Turner Syndrome.
By the time Clare was in her late 30s, infertility treatment had moved on and
she and her husband decided to try IVF with an egg from a donor as she could not
produce her own.
Clare has now turned her attention to helping other sufferers get faster
treatment and diagnosis.
Turner Syndrome, which also impairs growth, does not run in families.
As a result many sufferers don't find out they have the condition until they are
too old to fully benefit from growth hormone treatment.
The condition, a
chromosomal disorder, occurs randomly and affects only females.
As patients are born without ovaries they are often alerted only when puberty
fails to start, although growth hormones are only fully effective if taken from
as young as eight.
Clare's parents persuaded doctors to investigate her short height but no one
connected her ear, nose and throat problems, which were also symptoms of the
disease.
Clare says she has always been open about her condition with her husband and
could not have got through the heartache without him.
As Turner Syndrome affects one in every 2,500 girls and women, it is classed as
a rare disease.
TURNER SYNDROME CAUSES Short stature - sufferers are always under between 4ft
3in and 4ft 9in high Hearing problems Difficulties in concentration and spatial
awareness Infertility - All women with Turner syndrome either have no ovaries or
ovaries that do not function High blood pressure

AN extremely rare disease has hit close to home for a Launceston family.
Launceston university student Keisha Nielsen said her six-year-old niece
Kirniesha was diagnosed with Cloves Syndrome in April this year.
At this stage, Kirniesha is one of only two in Australia and 55 in the world to
be diagnosed with the disease.
Miss Nielsen said doctors were initially puzzled by Kirniesha's condition.
Miss Nielsen said there could be more Australian families affected by Cloves
Syndrome who didn't know it yet.
"It is a very newly recognised disease, and not a lot of people have heard about
it," Miss Nielsen said.
Miss Nielsen has raised almost $1000 for the Cloves Syndrome Foundation through
support from local businesses and by selling awareness bracelets.

A MOTHER-of-two who is one of only 200 people reported to have suffered with
Maffucci Syndrome hopes that more research can be carried out into the extremely
rare disease.
Tor Leak-Jones, of Kidderminster, was diagnosed with the rare bone and skin
disorder when she was 17 after being originally diagnosed with Ollier's Disease
at 18 months old.
She hopes to fund more research into the disease by hosting a family fun event
in aid of the SCAT Bone Cancer Trust on Saturday at Wilden All Saints CofE
Primary School as part of Rare Disease Day.
Miss Leak-Jones, 33, said: "My consultants have said they had only seen one or
two patients who have got a tumour at the base of the skull the same as me.
The condition also causes blood vessels to gather, known as hemangiomas, in Miss
Leak-Jones' organs.
"My condition puts a lot of pressure on my right side as well as the day to day
pain of the left hand side.
"When you stop and think about it, you have got this condition that does make
your life very different and it's not just physically, it's mentally.
"It's coping with the condition that makes you look a bit different, made you
miss school and have lots of operations and hospital visits.
Rare Disease Day is a global initiative taking place tomorrow that aims to raise
awareness of rare diseases and the impact they can have on sufferers and their
families.

ALIEN hand syndrome where the patient's hand develops a will of its own and can
attack its owner is one of hundreds of new and rare medical conditions making
diagnosis harder for doctors.
There are about 10,000 medical diagnoses doctors must choose from when
confronted with a sick patient and about 200 new conditions are discovered each
year, a US expert said.
Almost one in three patients who seek a second medical opinion have a diagnostic
error discovered, he said.
Many of the new diseases doctors must keep abreast of are inconsequential
variations in common viruses but others are significant.
Alien hand syndrome can occur when a person has had the two hemispheres of their
brain surgically separated to control epilepsy or it can be the result of a
stroke, infection or tumour.
Another example of a rare disease is yellow nail syndrome where the patient's
nails are thick and yellow, their limbs are swollen and suffer respiratory
problems.

Lundbeck: Raise Your Hand to Support People with Rare Diseases

LENGTH: 1358  words


New Delhi, Feb. 3 -- Today, Lundbeck announced its third annual Raise Your Hand
to Fight Rare Diseases campaign in support of Rare Disease Day, a worldwide
observance on February 29 to increase awareness of rare diseases.
When an
individual clicks the Raise Your Hand icon posted on the National Organization
for Rare Disorders (NORD) Rare Disease Day website (www.rarediseaseday.us),
Lundbeck will make an unrestricted donation to NORD's general research fund.
"There is limited funding available to support research on the nearly 7,000 rare
diseases affecting nearly 30 million Americans,"1 said Peter L. Saltonstall,
NORD president and CEO.
With Lundbeck's donations to our
general research fund over the past two years, we've been able to initiate
studies for Stiff-Person Syndrome and Systemic Sclerosis, two severe and very
rare disorders."
Lundbeck's 2010 donation supported a study by Eric Lancaster, MD, for
Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS), a rare, acquired neurological disorder2 believed to
affect fewer than one in 1 million people.3 Results are expected to be released
early this year with the hope of decreasing the time to reach a diagnosis of
SPS.
Lundbeck's 2011 donation supports a study of systemic sclerosis, a rare
autoimmune disorder affecting an estimated 49,000 people in the U.S.4 This
disease causes damage to the skin, but also involves the tissues beneath, blood
vessels, and major organs such as the intestines, lungs, heart, and kidneys.4
Led by Silvia Laura Bosello, MD, the study is aimed at improving the
identification of abnormal B-cells and administering medications that are known
to positively affect the production of B-cells.
Our focus on making a difference for patients, no matter how complex
the condition, is what drives us at Lundbeck every day," said Staffan Schuberg,
president of Lundbeck.
"Our continued partnership with NORD reflects our overall
efforts to push forward research and innovation that can have a positive impact
on patients, families and caregivers."
Lundbeck is doing all it can to provide support today while driving research and
innovation for patients with challenging neurologic and psychiatric conditions.
In the last three years, Lundbeck has introduced three therapies for rare
central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including ONFI (clobazam), which became
available in January and is approved as add-on treatment of seizures associated
with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) in people 2 years of age and older.
In addition to epilepsy, Lundbeck has invested significant resources toward
Huntington's disease (HD), another rare CNS disorder, through community-based
programs and its HD Research Initiative.
About Rare Diseases

There are approximately 7,000 rare diseases or conditions affecting an estimated
30 million Americans,1 though the number of individuals confronting any one of
these disorders can be quite small.
In the United States, rare diseases, also
referred to as "orphan conditions," are generally defined as diseases that
affect fewer than 200,000 Americans.1 Compared to individuals with more common

difficulty in finding medical experts, delay in receiving an accurate diagnosis,

About Rare Disease Day

Rare Disease Day is an annual event observed worldwide on the last day of
February each year.
The purpose of the day is to raise awareness of rare
diseases as a public health issue and bring together patients and families with
rare diseases to discuss the need for greater awareness, more research, and
better access to diagnosis and treatment.1 Rare Disease Day was first launched
in 2008 in Europe by the European Rare Disease Organization, EURORDIS, a sister
organization to NORD.
In 2009, other countries throughout the world joined
EURODIS to observe the day.5 NORD, which represents the nearly 30 million
Americans affected by rare diseases,1 is the sponsor of Rare Disease Day in the
United States.

Mason has been diagnosed with a rare disease known as Angelman Syndrome (AS), a
disease that is not well known within the local community, but that is something
that Troy is determined to change.
On August 3 Troy will be the under card in a headline fight at the Fortitude
Boxing Gymnasium against three different weight classed boxers in six
heart-pumping rounds, and is hoping to raise at least $5000 for the Foundation
for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics (FAST) and help raise awareness of the rare
disease.
"This disease receives no form of government funding to help find a cure so we
are basically on our own here," Troy said.
"Fortitude Boxing gave me the opportunity to have this fight night and talk
about the disease and use the night as a way to raise funds for the foundation.
"I just want to make enough noise that we can walk down the street and ask
someone "~do you know what Angelman Syndrome is', like you would do with autism
or Down syndrome, and their answer would be yes."

ANGELMAN SYNDROME

 Angelman Syndrome is caused by a severe reduction of expression of the gene
UBE3A in the brain.
Angelman Syndrome affects only one in 15,000 people

These figures were taken from the FAST website.

Special love for special needs;
Parents of kids with rare diseases learn to soldier on despite the financial and
emotional stress

The joys of parenthood are complicated by bewilderment when parents learn of
disorders they never knew existed - Antley- Bixler syndrome, Pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex deficiency, Cornelia de Lange syndrome and spinal muscular
atrophy.
Little Kang En Ning has Antley-Bixler syndrome, a rare genetic disorder.
Apart from organ complications, babies with Antley-Bixler syndrome have a flat
forehead and bulging eyes, and abnormally long and knobbly or spider fingers.
There are about 6,000 to 8,000 rare diseases worldwide.
As rare disorders are often life- threatening, patients need a host of
treatments, operations and therapies.
Mr Kenneth Mah, 42, vice-president of the Rare Disorders Society (Singapore),
says living expenses alone for a child with a rare disease averages $2,500 a
month for essentials including special milk, tubing and medication.
Explaining Grace's condition, Dr Derrick Chan, head and consultant of neurology
service at KKH, says this is a "rare disorder of the power source of the body's
cells, the mitochondria".
Mr Mah says he knows of an incident where a stranger's blunt words hurt a mother
whose son has Cornelia de Lange syndrome, which shows clearly in facial
deformities.

The
Jacksonville youngster has a rare disease called Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, of
which there are only 600 cases reported worldwide.
The StarLight Project, a nonprofit that partners with the Down Syndrome
Association of Jacksonville, provided the makeover.
The 4-year-old has a
rare disease.
Taylor continued, "And they sent her to St. Francis Hospital, where she stayed
for 31 days, where she had a biopsy and it was discovered that she had a rare
autoimmune diseased called Goodpasture's Syndrome."
According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
DIsease(http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov), "Goodpasture's syndrome is a rare disease
that can affect the lungs and kidneys.
Also called anti-glomerular basement
antibody disease, it is an autoimmune disease condition in which the body's own
defense system reacts against some part of the body itself.
In
Goodpasture's syndrome, the immune system makes antibodies that attack the lungs
and kidneys.
"We were told that it was a rare disease and that one in a million people had
it, and they were not sure how she got it, but she did," said Taylor.

A HAPPY and cheerful' toddler is battling a rare disease which affects her
liver, heart and kidneys.
Two-year-old Rosie Gill suffers from Alagille Syndrome, a genetic disorder that
causes abnormalities in many of her major organs.
As a result the youngster, who lives in Marple Bridge with her mum Clare and dad
Chris, suffers from liver disease, heart problems, and is also unable to absorb
vitamins.
Chris says that although Rosie was born with the condition, it did not come to
light until she first became ill around the time she turned two in July last
year.
He said: She was diagnosed with liver disease at Stepping Hill.
She was then
moved to St James' in Leeds where she had an operation and received treatment.
That was when she was diagnosed with Alagille Syndrome.
He says that despite operations and ongoing treatment, Rosie takes it all in her
stride, and remains cheerful and upbeat.
Chris explained: It is possible to control the condition with medication, so it
won't go away but hopefully it won't get worse.

State researchers uncover root of rare disease

Oklahoma medical researchers have located the genetic mutation that causes
Adams-Oliver Syndrome, a disease so rare that only 100 cases ever have been
reported.
The disease can cause scarring on the scalp; hand and foot defects; diminished
height; and mental deficiencies, according to a news release from the Oklahoma
Medical Research Foundation.
Drawing on seven samples from two families with the syndrome, Gaffney was able
to isolate the disease's cause: a gene called RBPJ.
Mutations cause the gene to "create protein that doesn't behave normally,
leading to symptoms of the disease," the release states.
The discovery is unlikely to change medical treatment of the disease but could
be used to test for the disorder and for genetic counseling purposes.
"Knowing that it's Adams-Oliver Syndrome, even though there's no specific
treatment, means doctors will know about future symptoms and can plan for them,"
Gaffney said in the release.
"If patients know they have the disease, it can
also help them make more informed choices about family planning."

Vanessa has Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about 1 in
10,000 kids, almost all girls.
The disease renders her unable to walk, talk and
care for herself.
She was diagnosed with Rett syndrome when she was 8, thanks in part to her home
specialist and school para, Vicki Ball.
Ball read about Rett syndrome in a

Abeona Therapeutics Announces FDA Allowance of Investigational New Drug (IND)
for Phase 1/2 Clinical Study with ABO-101 Gene Therapy for Patients With
Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B (MPS IIIB)

LENGTH: 1181  words


May 24 -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: ABEO), a clinical-stage
biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering gene therapy and plasma-based
products for severe and life-threatening rare diseases, today announced the FDA
has allowed an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for its Phase 1/2
Clinical Study with gene therapy candidate ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU) for patients with
Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB) to be conducted at Nationwide Children's
Hospital (Columbus, OH).
This is the second FDA allowance for a gene therapy
trial from Abeona this year, following allowance of an IND in February for
ABO-102, for patients with MPS IIIA which commenced with dosing of the first
cohort of patients this month.
"As seen in
other gene therapy trials, using AAV9 delivered by intravenous injection has
strong potential to treat patients with Sanfilippo type B, a disease with
profound central nervous system manifestations."
"Abeona is committed to building a leadership position in the development of
innovative treatments for orphan diseases, and this second FDA IND allowance
represents an important milestone in advancing our rare disease product pipeline
to the clinic," stated Steven H. Rouhandeh, Executive Chairman of Abeona.
"We
remain active from a corporate development perspective in identifying
complementary orphan drug programs as well as potential co-development partners,
towards our goal of achieving value for our patients, their families, our
academic partners and other stakeholders."
A Natural History Study for Sanfilippo, conducted by Nationwide Children's
Hospital, has been completed in 25 patients to characterize how the rare disease
progresses in its natural state.
Information about a rare disease's natural
history aids in clinical trial design, identifying study end points and
developing and validating clinical outcome measures, and biomarkers.
Given the high level of need for
therapies for Sanfilippo syndromes, we remain committed to advancing both our
AAV-based gene therapy programs, ABO-101 and ABO-102, targeting two types of the
inherited genetic disease, MPS IIIB and MPS IIIA."
In addition to the NINDS, our entire team would
like to thank many patient and family foundations for their longstanding support
and financial commitment to advancing research and developing treatments for
this heartbreaking disease."
About Sanfilippo syndromes: Sanfilippo syndromes (or mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS)
type III) are a group of four inherited genetic diseases each caused by a single
gene defect, described as type A, B, C or D, which cause enzyme deficiencies
that result in the abnormal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (sugars) in body
tissues.
MPS III is a lysosomal storage disease, a group of rare inborn errors
of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function.
Babies may show little sign of the disease, but as more and more cells
become damaged, symptoms start to appear.
Importantly, there is no cure for MPS III and treatments are
largely supportive care.
About ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU): ABO-101 is next generation adeno-associated viral
(AAV)-based gene therapy for MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome), which involves a
one-time delivery of a normal copy of the defective gene to cells of the central
nervous system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that
cause the disease.
Preclinical in-vivo efficacy studies
in Sanfilippo syndrome have demonstrated functional benefits that remain for
months after treatment.
A single dose of ABO-101 significantly restored normal
cell and organ function, corrected cognitive defects that remained months after
drug administration, increased neuromuscular control and increased the lifespan
of animals with MPS III over 100% one year after treatment compared to untreated
control animals.
These results are consistent with studies from several
laboratories suggesting AAV treatment could potentially benefit patients with
for Sanfilippo syndrome Type A and B, respectively.
In addition, safety studies
conducted in animal models of Sanfilippo syndromes have demonstrated that
delivery of AB0-101 are well tolerated with minimal side effects.

Thousands of dollars pour in to fight girl's rare disease

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO -- A couple's efforts to raise money for research into their
daughter's rare genetic disease yielded more than $125,000 this year, the family
reported.
The money will go toward finding a cure for Morquio syndrome, a debilitating
condition that afflicts 2-year-old Ariana Kallas.
Her parents, George and Bertha Kallas, have organized nine fundraising events
since February in a grassroots effort to fund research for a disease that occurs
in about 1 in 200,000 births.
Morquio syndrome is a disorder in which the body does not produce the proper
enzyme to break down long chains of glucose.
Children with Morquio syndrome
stop growing by age 8, and most are confined to wheelchairs by their teen years.
Morquio patients often don't live past their 30s.
Fundraising for such a rare disease has proven difficult, but the Kallases
aren't alone: Tomatsu's research is also supported by at least 11 other Morquio
organizations.
Ariana has suffered some of the disease's early symptoms.

Teen starts 5K to fight rare disease

BYLINE: Devika Rao; For the AJC

SECTION: METRO NEWS; Pg.
Winders was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome in May
2010, and wanted to support the first event in Atlanta that brought awareness
for the rare disease.
The disease causes rapid muscle exhaustion and weakness making it
hard for Winders and those like her to have enough energy for everyday
activities.
The 5K was the brainchild of Kimby Wragg, 15, who wanted to raise money and
awareness for the disease that has affected her young step-cousin.
"It was
really hard to see her go through all the pain, and so I wanted to do something
to raise money for this disease," she said.
Guillain-Barre Syndrome is an auto-immune disease that affects the nerves
outside the brain and spinal cord.
The disease damages myelin, the protective
covering of the nerve, which can lead to numbness and even paralysis.
Chronic
Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy is a rare disorder of the peripheral
nerves characterized by gradually increasing weakness of the legs and, to a
lesser extent, the arms.
"Because these diseases are so rare, many doctors may never see a patient with
GBS or CIDP, so one of the greatest challenges for patients is getting a quick
and accurate diagnosis," said Bob Nelson, deputy director of GBS/CIDP Foundation
International.
"If these diseases are correctly diagnosed in a timely manner,
proper treatment can begin, which can literally be life-saving."
"I plan on continuing to host fundraisers and spreading the message of this
disease," she said.
GBS is rare and occurs in about 1.5 people in every 100,000 people each year.
We are
able to provide one-on-one support for newly diagnosed patients, and also find
support within this small community."

Washington: FDA approves Vimizim to treat rare congenital enzyme disorder

LENGTH: 427  words

DATELINE: Washington


US Food and Drug Administration, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Vimizim (elosulfase alfa),
the first FDA-approved treatment for Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (Morquio A
syndrome).
Morquio A syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage
disease caused by a deficiency in N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase
(GALNS).
There are approximately 800 patients with
Morquio A syndrome in the United States.
An FDA priority review provides for an
expedited review of drugs for serious diseases or conditions that may offer
major advances in treatment.
Vimizim is also the first drug to receive the Rare
Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher - a provision that aims to encourage
development of new drugs and biologics for the prevention and treatment of rare
pediatric diseases.
"This approval and rare pediatric disease priority review voucher underscores
the agency's commitment to making treatments available to patients with rare
diseases," said Andrew E. Mulberg, M.D., deputy director, Division of
Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products in the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research (CDER).
"Prior to today's approval, patients with this
rare disease have had no approved drug treatment options."
The safety and effectiveness of Vimizim were established in a clinical trial
involving 176 participants with Morquio A syndrome, ranging in age from 5 to 57
years.
On average, patients
treated with Vimizim in the trial walked 22.5 meters farther in 6 minutes
compared to the patients who received placebo.
The most common side effects in patients treated with Vimizim during clinical
trials included fever, vomiting, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, chills and
fatigue.
The safety and effectiveness of Vimizim have not been established in
pediatric patients less than 5 years of age.
During clinical trials,
life-threatening anaphylactic reactions occurred in some patients during Vimizim
infusions.
Vimizim is marketed by Novato, Calif.-based BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.

Support group meeting challenges for rare diseases

BYLINE:  Charles E. Buban

LENGTH: 802  words


Pompe disease is so rare that few doctors in the world knew about it.
What is
even fewer are the treatment options available considering this genetic disorder
is not at the top of the agenda of many drug research companies.
After seeing a muscular
dystrophy specialist in San Francisco, United States, that Juan's condition was
accurately identified.
The many
signs and symptoms are not unique to Pompe disease.
Pompe disease could only be identified after taking a blood test of the creatine
kinase (a protein found mainly in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle) and a
muscle biopsy (in which muscle tissue is examined for excessive glycogen storage
and degeneration).
"Pompe disease generally progresses very rapidly among babies and is
almost always fatal by the age of one, usually from heart and/or breathing
failure whereas a Pompe disease that developed later in life, like what Juan
had, is not as fatal as symptoms could be managed if addressed promptly," said
Cynthia, who is happy to report that Juan is doing well at 36.
In fact, he was able to keep his condition at bay, enabling him to
finish college-he is an Industrial Design graduate from the De La Salle-College
of Saint Benilde-and work.
He has always been a patient-advocate of the Philippine Society for
Orphan Disorders (www.psod.org.ph), a nonprofit organization that aims to help
individuals in the Philippines who suffer from rare disorders.
Expensive

Cynthia, who is also PSOD's president, said: "Like most rare diseases, Pompe
disease is expensive to manage, considering one needs a team of specialists such
as cardiologist, neurologist and respiratory therapist.
In addition to enzyme
replacement therapy, supportive care is critical if patients with Pompe's
disease are to maximize their abilities and quality of life.
This is also why, through PSOD, Cynthia and a number of dedicated doctors and
experts have been relentlessly sourcing the much-needed funds from foreign and
local donors, as well as arrange with drug companies to make available under
compassionate use the special food formulas, medications and enzyme replacement
therapies crucial to sustaining and improving the health condition of patients.
"My son is not the only one afflicted with rare diseases.
The Institute of Human
Genetics of the National Institutes of Health of the University of the
Philippines Manila has identified over 300 Filipinos, mostly children, afflicted
with over 40 types of rare disorders.
Aside from Pompe disease, other conditions
identified include Apert Syndrome, Galactosemia, Homocystinuria, Lowe Syndrome,
and Muscular Dystrophy."
Message to Filipinos

Recently, Cynthia's group joined the world in celebrating the 7th Rare Disease
Day at the SM Mall of Asia (MOA) globe area in a simple candle-lighting
ceremony.
According to the PSOD, the event sent a message to the Filipinos,
especially children afflicted with rare disorders and their families that they
are not alone in the struggle for a better quality of life.
"This was the day (Feb. 28 was International Rare Disease Day) where countries
all over the world conduct a high visibility campaign for rare disease.
Here in
the Philippines, we emphasized how important it is for Filipino parents to
identify if their child is inflicted with a rare disease so that their children
can live productive and normal lives," Cynthia said.
But more than support from organizations and pharmaceutical companies, PSOD is
hoping a law would soon be passed here in the country to help patients with rare
diseases.
"What we need is perhaps some sort of access to medical treatment and
drugs.
I know that our children's cases are rare but we believe we still deserve
some form of assistance from the government," Cynthia said.

assist Filipinos with rare diseases)

Campaign success for Sam, 6, as drug reinstated for rare Morquio syndrome

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 561 words


THE family of a six-year-old boy has been told that a drugs company will
reinstate the free provision of a drug which was vastly improving his health
when he was on a clinical trial of it.
Sam Brown's parents, Katy and Sam, campaigned for their son to continue to
receive Vimizim, used to treat the ultra-rare Morquio Syndrome.
Now drugs company BioMarin has announced it is to reinstate the free provision
to the 34 patients who were on the clinical trial.
Just 88 people in England have the ultra-rare disease Morquio Syndrome, of whom
34 were on the clinical.
The MPS Society, the charity supporting those with Morquio Syndrome and their
families, has received numerous reports of clinical deterioration of Morquio
patients since supply was stopped on June 25.
218 people
across the UK are affected by these ultra-rare conditions and all of whom have
been let down repeatedly by failure of process.
Most of those
with the condition were never on the clinical trial and their conditions will
continue to worsen until NICE makes a decision.
As well as a positive
decision on Vimizim, we also need a better, faster process for approval of drugs
that does allow for the approval of drugs for ultra-rare diseases when they are
shown to be effective and ministers must start taking responsibility and put one
in place."
Mr Mulholland has led two parliamentary debates, supported by MPs of all
parties, on the issue of access to drugs for ultra-rare diseases.

Guillain-Barre syndrome is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks
part of the peripheral nervous system.
Occasionally, surgery or
vaccinations will trigger the syndrome.
No one yet knows why
Guillain-Barré strikes some people and not others or what sets this rare disease
in motion.
Many patients require
regular infusions of Gamma Globulin to keep from becoming paralyzed again.
Disability and financial strain disrupts lives of patients and families.
To increase awareness of this rare disease, May has been declared GBS Awareness
Month.

The Birmingham schoolgirl who gulped down BOTTLES of tomato sauce, BLOCKS of
butter and spoonfuls of SALT due to eating disorder;
Aneeba, now 23, from Erdington, suffers from a rare disease called
Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (LMBBS)

Schoolgirl Aneeba Ahmed hid in the kitchen as she gulped down an entire bottle
of TOMATO SAUCE.
Because Aneeba, now 23, from Erdington, suffers from a rare disease called
Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (LMBBS).
Others are not so lucky and are still battling the strange syndrome.
The student was diagnosed from an early age with LMBBS - an inherited genetic
condition that affects approximately one in 100,000 babies.
For up until the age of 13, there was a risk that Aneeba had another closely
related disease which sees patients deteriorate rapidly around the age of 11.
She is one of thousands of patients with rare diseases treated at the Queen
Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham every year.
For many of the patients, their conditions are so complex that they need to see
a number of different specialists at different dates and at different sites
round the UK.
The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham Charity is raising £1 million to create
a Rare Diseases Centre at the hospital.
The idea is that as well as creating a place that will allow experts to share
their knowledge more easily, patients will benefit by being able to have all
their appointments on the same day rather than spread out through the year.
By
holding one-day clinics, the centre will also enable families to meet others
with the same condition and share experiences and knowledge.
Sarah Borrows, Clinical Nurse Specialist Renal Genetics, who cares for patients
with LMBSS at QEHB says: "Due to the complex nature of many rare diseases
patients need to attend multiple clinics for the different aspects of the
condition.
"It has been reported that this often leads to a general lack of awareness, and
lack of experience, amongst healthcare professionals when caring for patient
with rare diseases.
"This, in turn can lead to inequitable access to co-ordinated quality care,
resulting in patients feeling isolated and frustrated with the healthcare
system.
"The national LMBBS clinic at QEHB has been designed to provide a 'one-stop'
clinic ensuring patients with diagnosed or suspected LMBBS receive expert
attention and co-ordinated management.
The Rare Disease Centre will be able to
offer this clinic model to a wide range of rare diseases."

Raising awareness of one of rarest diseases in world

ALSTRÖM Syndrome UK, a small national charity based in Paignton, is being
showcased to GPs throughout the UK.
Alström is one of the rarest diseases in the world - and the charity has long
been fighting for greater awareness to improve diagnosis, particularly early
diagnosis, among GPs.
Dr Mike Hales, programme manager for Alström Syndrome UK, is currently managing
a £350,000 research programme which involves Torbay Hospital, Birmingham
Children's Hospital and the University of Cambridge - an in-depth study that is
bringing new hope to those suffering with this debilitating disease.
His case study of Alström Syndrome is being published in the Royal College of
General Practitioners' February newsletter.
The founder and chief executive of
the charity is Paignton mum Kay Parkinson, who tragically lost both her children
to the disease.
Ever since, she has been fighting, and winning, a battle to make
sure that newly diagnosed patients have better chances of survival than her son
Matthew and daughter Charlotte.
By the time doctors diagnosed their many symptoms as Alström Syndrome it was too
late and both died in their 20s.
Kay said:"We have been building our links with GPs for some time and promoting
our medical handbook, but 'This opportunity to reach GPs through their own
newsletter is fantastic in terms of spreading awareness'

"Not surprisingly, with Alström being so rare, many GPs have been completely
unaware of it - as a result, we know of people who have gone undiagnosed for
years."
It is one of a group of rare
diseases classed as ciliopathies.
In particular, Kay is one of a small European team spearheading a widespread
programme to develop support, information and research aimed at improving
diagnostics, care, knowledge and treatment.
It is called the Euro-WABB project
as it combines the experience and knowledge of people closely involved in
Wolfram, Alström and Bardet-Biedl (WABB) syndromes.
Alström Syndrome can affect
sight, hearing, heart and other major organs and lead to diabetes and obesity.
The Paignton-based charity was
instrumental in establishing the first NHS multi-disciplinary clinics for AS
patients, in Torbay and Birmingham, and have continued to be at the forefront of
a variety of national and international initiatives concerned with rare
diseases.

HEART-IPS: Congenital heart disease-associated arrhythmia: deciphering Hamamy
syndrome, novel rare disease, using iPS cells

LENGTH: 400  words


EU contribution: EUR 202 405
Objective: In the growing population of patients with congenital heart defects
(CHD), while arrhythmias are not a major issue for children, they are a leading
complication during adulthood.
Thus, studying causes of CHDs may reveal key steps, mis-regulated in adult
patients with CHD, leading to arrhythmias.Cardiac development and adult
electrical function are finely regulated by transcription factors (TFs).
Mutations in TFs have previously been linked to patients with CHD who are
developing arrhythmias in adulthood.
Hamamy syndrome is a newly described rare
disease with CHD and rhythm disorders, caused by a mutation in IRX5 TF.
In adult
mice, Irx5 is known to regulate cardiac electrical function.I hypothesize that
IRX5 mutation in Hamamy-affected patients, leads to misregulation of heart
development, promoting arrhythmic events during adulthood.I already generated
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from Hamamy patients and a transgenic mouse
expressing the Irx5 mutation.The project will be focused on three aims: 1.
Understanding the
syndrome s molecular mechanism.This study will provide immediate insight into
understanding fundamental processes by which some arrhythmias in the adult
originate in cardiac development.
As such, it represents a
promising model to study disease mechanisms, optimize patient care (personalized
medicine), and aid in the development of new therapies.

Oct. 15--BAKER -- Tyler Meeks finally knows what to call the disease he has
struggled with for 17 years.
In August, doctors diagnosed the Baker School student with Behcet's disease, a
disorder that inflames blood vessels throughout his body.
The syndrome causes a
number of seemingly unrelated symptoms, from skin lesions to inflammation of the
joints.
While treating another Behcet's patient, one of Tyler's doctors finally
connected the boy's symptoms to the disease.
In November, Tyler has an appointment at the Behcet's Syndrome Center in
Manhattan.
The center, the only one of its kind in the United States, promises a
new treatment plan or a clinical trial for Tyler.

* Boys, 8 and 6, who suffer from the genetic disorder Hurler-Scheie syndrome,
will take part in medical trials in New York.
A rare disease shared by the brothers could kill them within a decade.
But an
experimental treatment they are about to begin could return their lives to a
semblance of normalcy.
Sean, 8, and Cody, 6, were diagnosed in July with Hurler-Scheie syndrome, one of
a variety of disorders known as MPS-I.
Hurler-Scheie syndrome is a rare genetic
disorder that affects about one in every 115,000 births.
Those affected with the disorder rarely live beyond their mid-20s.
This week, the boys will start an experimental drug protocol aimed at
controlling the symptoms and halting the progress of the disease.
The Merrell family is flying to New York on Sunday to take part in the next
phase of the trial, a six-month double-blind study involving 42 patients in
North America and Europe.
The disease has attacked the boys' joints and made it difficult for them to
write their schoolwork at Festus Elementary School or keep up with the other
children on the playground.
Genzyme spokesman Bo Piela said once the testing is completed, Genzyme will
provide Aldurazyme to the boys at no cost, pending approval of the treatment by
Food and Drug Administration.
"After the trial is over, all the patients who want to will be switched over to
the drug," Piela said.
The first trial of Aldurazyme in 1998 involved 10 patients.
Two of the patients
involved in the initial study have died of complications from the genetic
disorder.
He
is now 11 and continues to receive the weekly treatments.
Spencer's mother, Amy Holland, said her son's liver has shrunk by 40 percent
since he began the treatment.
Holland said she has no doubt that the treatment is working.

Rare disease of brain kills teenage daughter of Michael Warren

   The teenaged daughter of former Canada Post chief Michael Warren has died of
Reye's Syndrome, an incurable and rapidly spreading disease of the brain.
The rare disease, which mainly attacks young people, usually develops in
conjunction with viral infections.
Reye's Syndrome has also been linked to the
use of ASA (acetylsalicylic acid, a common headache medicine) to treat flu and
other infections.
That night, they transferred Vicki to the Hospital for Sick Children,
where a liver biopsy confirmed the disease.
A flap was made in her skull to
decrease pressure on the brain, but the disease spread quickly.
"I had heard the name before, but I didn't know what Reye's Syndrome was,"
Warren said.
Four days after doctors pinpointed the disease, it killed her
daughter.
"I've since learned that, once children turn 16, the incidence of Reye's
Syndrome falls off dramatically and, after 18, there are almost no cases at
all," Warren said.
She said doctors told her Reye's Syndrome is hard to diagnose
because its symptoms are similar to many other innocent illnesses.
Most patients who recover from Reye's syndrome have no lasting damage.
The Warren family is encouraging donations to the Reye's Syndrome Foundation.

He further said as it is a rare disease and sometime it is not
diagnosed by the doctors.
He said the syndrome appeared to be triggered by acute viral or bacterial
illnesses, such as respiratory or gastrointestinal infections, occurring one to
three weeks earlier.
Other names for Guillain-Barr' syndrome include
acute idiopathic polyneuritis, acute idiopathic polyradiculoneuritis and
Landry's ascending paralysis.He said as Sunil was diagnosed by him, after having
a discussion with his family members, he immediately sent Sunil to
Neuro-physician and specialist Dr Shasen Saxena for further treatment.
He further said that for further
treatment, Sunil is being sent to the Himalayan Institute and the cost of
treatment will be more than Rs 1.5 lakh which will be spent by the trust.
However, the challenge is not yet over, as Rs 3 or 4 lakh more were needed for
the complete treatment, and the doctor couple is hopeful that the life of the
patient will be saved.
The disease, which in most cases leads to immediate death
due to ignorance, had been diagnosed in time, thus increasing the chances of the
patient's survival.
The relatives and parents of Sunil thanked the doctor couple
for their financial support and guidance and said that his mother was on the
verge of dying and as they were not in a position to collect the sum required
for the treatment of their son, they termed the help of Rs 3 lakh as no less
than God sent.Sunil Sanon was also critical of the government machinery towards
the patient needing immediate operative care, and said that the procedure for
receiving funds from the 'Vyadhi Nidhi Kosh' was so cumbersome that by the time
the paper work was completed, the patient would have died.
The research showed that providing education about conditions that cause facial
paralysis helps people correct their misperceptions.
Bogart is an expert on ableism, or prejudice about disabilities, and her
research focuses on the psychosocial implications of facial movement disorders
such as facial paralysis and Parkinson's disease, which affect more than 200,000
Americans.
Her interest stems from personal experience; she has Moebius syndrome
, a rare congenital neurological disorder characterized by facial paralysis and
impaired lateral eye movement.
"We found that awareness and education efforts are effective in reducing stigma
related to rare disabilities such as facial paralysis," Bogart said.
"That could
have a broad impact on the rare disease community, because many rare diseases
are unrecognizable.
People who encounter someone with a rare disease may not
understand or know how to adapt to communicate with them."
Bogart is now developing educational materials about Moebius Syndrome targeted
to educators and health care providers.
She and the students in her lab also are
conducting an awareness campaign in conjunction with Moebius Syndrome Awareness
Day, which is held annually on Jan. 24.
The Moebius Syndrome Foundation and several other
college campuses are also participating in the campaign.
In the future, Bogart hopes to study the effectiveness of such educational
efforts to determine if more information should be included, if other types of
groups might be targeted or if there are other ways to enhance understanding of
rare diseases such as facial paralysis.

TAY'S syndrome, a rare disease characterised by unusually dry skin and brittle
hair, is named after local physician Tay Chong Hai.
The striations on the oddly jointed hairs became the key distinguishing
characteristic of Tay's syndrome.
The stage was set for the discovery of Tay's syndrome by several prior
achievements, including discovering the poison arsenic in traditional Chinese
medicine pills for asthma in the 1960s.

Province announces rare disease drug plan

The New Brunswick government has announced a strategy to help people struggling
with the high cost of treatments for a number of rare diseases.
The Health Department said on Monday it has established the New Brunswick Drugs
for Rare Diseases Plan, which will cover expensive medications for people
suffering with uncommon afflictions.
The announcement comes after years of pleas, protests and petitions from people
and their families affected by rare, debilitating illnesses and sky-high
treatment bills.
One of those people, Annette Sebey of Perth-Andover, now will be able to access
the enzyme-replacement treatment she needs to treat late-onset Pompe disease - a
progressive, debilitating and often fatal neuromuscular condition caused by an
enzyme deficiency.
She is one of only 40 people in Canada, and the only person in New Brunswick,
with the disease.
"I will be joyous, once I am sitting in the chair for my first infusion in a New
Brunswick hospital," Sebey said in an interview from a Florida hospital where
she has been receiving treatments in a clinical drug trial.
Pompe patients in other provinces have been able to access treatment with the
costly drug, Myozyme.
But in New Brunswick, the treatment was not on a list of
accepted drugs, and the province did not have a special protocol to deal with
such rare occurrences.
In Monday's announcement, Pompe is included on the list of five drugs for
specific rare diseases that now will be covered by the province.
We agree there should be a rare disease policy, but I find this
announcement surprising.
Flemming said he still believes there should be a national strategy for rare
disease drug coverage.
New Brunswick will partner with Ontario to deliver the plan using a "drugs for
rare diseases framework."
Flemming said the framework gives New Brunswick
up-to-date information on rare disease drugs using the best available evidence
from the much larger province.
The plan will cover the cost of five drugs for specific rare diseases:

Aldurazyme for the treatment of Hurler and Hurler-Scheie forms of
Mucopolysaccharidosis I;

Elaprase for the treatment of Hunter Syndrome;

Ilaris for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome;

Myozyme for the treatment of Pompe disease; and

Zavesca for the treatment of Niemann-Pick Type C.

There will be no cost to patients.
"It really offers some hope to the few individuals in the province who have
these extremely rare diseases and, up to this point, have not had the same
access to care as other provinces in the country."
He said that in the case of the drug Aldurazyme, used for the treatment of
Hurler and Hurler-Scheie diseases, every other province has paid for the drug
except New Brunswick.
"You can appreciate that developing therapies for these diseases costs millions
of dollars and the application is very narrow in terms of the number of people
who can benefit," Messenger said.
According to the Canadian Association for Rare Disorders, nearly three million
Canadians suffer from a rare disease, approximately half of whom are children.
Of more than 7,000 rare diseases, treatments have been developed for only about
300 of them.

The almost 1.5 million Australians who live with a rare disease want a better
deal after years falling through the cracks in a health system focused on more
common illnesses

CHARLOTTE ELLIOTT, 7 (left)

DAW PARK

AT FIRST HE THOUGHT it was a mouse, gnawing away at the walls.
Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome is usually
first seen in children aged between three and 15 and causes uncontrollable
seizures that can be resistant to medications and other treatments.
It typically
affects boys and is seen in just one in a million children - Mark knows of two
others in Australia with the syndrome.
Mark says the hardships that come with having a desperately unwell child are
complicated when the child is suffering with a rare disease.
Upon learning her daughter had the condition - after
12 years of looking for a diagnosis - Alicia Brown scoured the internet, looking
for information, looking for hope.
Six months after the diagnosis, after she had watched her daughter battle with
the toll her condition was taking on her relationships, her self-esteem, Alicia
took Kiaana for walk and asked her if she would want to know if she had
something serious like cancer, something that could kill her.
Batten Disease is an inherited neurodegenerative condition.
The disease causes
the death of neurons but no one knows why.
There is nothing known that can stop or slow this and
each person is unique in their progression of the disease.
Batten Disease is found in about four of every 100,000 births, which means
Kiaana has also had to struggle with being isolated by a condition no one has
heard of, while Alicia is faced, not only with the reality of caring for a
terminally ill child, but the pressure of trying to raise awareness and funds to
find a cure.
When Kellie Campbell found out her daughter had Sanfilippo Syndrome
, her first question was "how do we fix it?".
A neurodegenerative disease seen in 1 in 70,000 live births, Sanfilippo Syndrome
will inexorably rob Mikayla of all of her skills, quirks, and memories.
With only three other cases of Sanfilippo known to Kellie in South Australia,
the isolation that comes with the diagnosis of a rare disease has compounded the
pain her family is experiencing.
Her
foundation aims to enable access to emerging treatments and trials, improve the
diagnosis pathway, raise awareness and improve the quality of life for children
with the syndrome.
"Families diagnosed with this condition can feel very isolated when even their
paediatrician or GP may not have heard of it, and are often in the dark about
where medical research is at and what options they may have for treatment," she
says.
"It can also be difficult to get the research and pharmaceutical world
interested in rare diseases as the commercial imperative is often not as obvious
as it is with 'big' diseases.
"Rare diseases like Sanfilippo Syndrome really have the capacity to touch a lot
of people and provide the opportunity for 'everyday people' to make a
significant difference in the lives of the affected."
Having had to recently cut Mikayla's long curly hair short as she was pulling it
out, Kellie says the hardest part of the syndrome is watching the daughter she
knows disappear.
Further investigation revealed Tayla has
the rare SDHB gene, a mutation that predisposes her to recurrent tumours of this
kind, generally with a high rate of malignancy.
Tayla's condition is unrelated to the cancer that
killed her brother.
She is
an advocate of the Unicorn Foundation which supports patients with
neuroendocrine cancers, and donates proceeds from the sale of her book of poetry
to the Women's and Children's Hospital.
When it comes to funding, research, and even
correct and timely diagnoses, close to 1.5 million Australians don't exist -
suffering from diseases and conditions so rare they are falling between the
cracks of a health system that fails to serve or recognise them.
Rare diseases
affect an astounding number of Australians: almost one and a half times the
number of people with diabetes.
A "rare disease" is defined as any disorder or
condition that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating with an estimated
prevalence of 5 in 10,000 - or of similarly low prevalence and high level of
complexity that special combined efforts are needed to address the disorder or
condition.
With little high-profile publicity or attention - there is no ribbon to wear, no
pavement to pound - those living with rare diseases have been largely forgotten.
There are more than 7000 rare diseases and many have no formal title and are
difficult to diagnose.
People living with rare diseases can go years searching for an explanation for
their symptoms.
Rare Voices Australia was formed in early 2012 as Australia's National Rare
Disease Alliance to promote health policy and a healthcare system that works for
those with rare diseases.
It is pushing for a National Rare Disease Plan, to
provide clear national guidance on rare disease management and research, a
co-ordinated response that can be delivered within existing resources, while
helping promote research and diagnosis, treatment and care.
Rare Voices Australia executive director Megan Fookes says the current situation
not only costs those with a rare disease in terms of quality of life, it is also
economically unsustainable.
Patients with rare diseases account for a
disproportionately high cost to the healthcare system in comparison to other
patients.
Some
can't work because they are caring for family members with a rare disease.
Mrs Fookes hopes Rare Voices Australia will deliver solutions to some of the
most pressing problems faced by those struggling for information, support,
appropriate treatments and understanding.
"These people haven't smoked, haven't
eaten too much, they were born with a rare condition through no fault of their
own," she says.
An SA Health spokeswoman says more work is needed before the state can adopt the
National Rare Diseases Plan proposed by Rare Voices.
International Rare Disease Day is on February 28 and this year will mark the 7th
event with more than 70 million rare disease patients globally raising awareness
on this day.

MKs, doctors seek 'parents' to adopt 'orphan diseases'

The Israel Medical Association has voiced its support for legislation that would
ensure state funding of lifesaving drugs for serious and even life-threatening
rare diseases, known as "orphan diseases," that affect thousands of Israelis.
While the US, Europe, Japan, Singapore and Australia all have orphan disease
laws that give incentives to drug companies to finance research, treatments and
cures, Israel still does not have these laws.
Among the orphan syndromes are
several incurable "Jewish diseases" such as Tay-Sachs, familial dysautonomia,
Canavan's disease and Neiman-Pick.
The bill would set
up a special fund for orphan disease treatments.
It would also provide tax
incentives and other benefits to drug companies, which produce treatments for
such diseases affecting 60,000 Israelis.
Guest speaker Dr. Marlene Haffner, director of the Office of Orphan Products
Development at the US Food and Drug Administration, said that there are "no
expensive drugs but expensive diseases."
She explained that although medications
for orphan disease are usually high priced, the financial benefits of a cure and
cutting down periodic treatment often makes the drugs cost-effective.
Leon Musikant, a computer specialist who heads EITAN - the Israel Association
for Rare Diseases, said that such syndromes could hit any family.
"I prefer to
call them 'poor diseases' rather than orphans because these rare disorders lack
money for treatment and research, and people have sympathy for orphans."
So far, the predicament of Israeli patients with some 300 rare diseases has not
found sympathy in the government, he said.
He urged that small centers for each
disease be set up, even if it is only one doctor coordinating it, and that
foreign foundations be encouraged to finance research and development of
treatments.
Israel has the unique ability to serve as a laboratory for the study
of many of these diseases, because of its diverse ethnic population and
inbreeding.
The IMA suggested that the health funds were trying to remove treatment for
Fabry's, but Berlovich dismissed the claims.
Considered the "father of orphan diseases," Prof. Robert Desnick, head of the
Human Genetics Department at New York's Mount Sinai Medical Center, spoke about
his role in the development of orphan drugs, which include Cerezyme for
Gaucher's disease and Fabryzyme for Fabry's disease.
A full report on orphan diseases, including an interview with Desnick, will
appear on the Health Page on July 31.

Every day Cindy Urso wakes up with a migraine-strength headache.
Urso is one of about 25,000 people in the United States struggling with
Intracranial Hypertension (IH), a rare disease in which the spinal fluid
pressure in the skull is too high causing severe headaches, vision loss or
blindness from swollen optic nerves and numerous additional symptoms.
Currently the IHRF is working to compile a global registry of individuals with
an IH diagnosis and a neuro-imaging library of IH patients' brain scans for
scientists to research possible commonalities.
Urso's daughter, Ashley, 20, has Down syndrome, and her son, Jan,
14, has Asperger's syndrome.
Urso says IH is "a lonely disease" because so little is known about it and
patients don't "look sick."
During very difficult times, Urso turns to the Internet for support from others
who are living with the disease.
During September, IH Awareness month, she hopes to make others aware of the rare
disease and how it affects others.
"I
don't want people to feel sorry for me or pity me, but know that there are rare
diseases out there and to know there are people out there walking around
struggling."

AN 11-year-old boy from   Stockwood is the only person in Britain to suffer from
a rare disease which means he has no immune system.
Jack Buchanan has tricho hepato enteric (THE) syndrome - a disorder which has
only ever been diagnosed 40 times worldwide.
So far, no-one with the condition has ever lived beyond their 21st birthday and
the majority die before they are five.
Mother Jaime Jones said the disease is like a ticking time bomb, which no parent
should ever had to endure.
Jaime was desperate for some kind of diagnosis for her son but it was not until
a specialist mapped out his genes that they found a mutation which identified
the rare condition.
I've spoken to other parents in America and
Australia whose children have the same condition and they find it very difficult
because there are no support groups out there.
"If it was Down's Syndrome or something similar, then you could meet other
parents in a similar situation."
The event at Ashton Park School on Monday also coincides with Rare Disease Day.
"His condition means he gets tired very quickly and becomes ill if he over
exerts himself.
"We saw that Monday  February 29 was Rare Disease Day and it seemed like a great
time to support the Grand Appeal, while helping raise awareness of such rare
conditions like THE.
This novel treatment is based on the idea that among such a large group of
people, resistance to the majority of illnesses will have been built up, helping
Jack fight off as many germs as possible.
Grand Appeal community fundraiser Laura Madams said: "Every penny that the Grand
Appeal raises helps us to make sure Bristol Children's Hospital can provide the
very best care possible to young patients like Jack.
We are very proud of the
amazing doctors and nurses we have on our doorstep here in Bristol, who have the
knowledge and expertise to care for children with such rare conditions.
"We'd like to say a huge thank-you to Jack, Jaime and of course Ashton Park
School and Luckwell Primary School for supporting us with their dress down day
on Rare Disease Day."
Rare Disease Day takes place on the last day of February each year.
The main objective of the event  is to raise awareness amongst the  public and
decision-makers about rare diseases and their impact on patients' lives.

Worthing teenager's family fight for awareness of rare disease

LENGTH: 676  words


The family of a teenager with an exceptionally rare disease are raising
awareness in a bid to find a cure.
Jennifer Lynch, 14, from Worthing, has Wolfram Syndrome, which can cause
diabetes, visual impairment, coordination, breathing, deafness, bladder and
neurological problems.
Wolfram Syndrome (WS) affects one in 500,000 children, and there is currently no
cure for the condition.
Charity Wolfram Syndrome UK is fundraising to support
research in to a drug that has been identified as showing signs of slowing down
or stopping the progression of the condition.
This was put down to her personality; it was
only once she was diagnosed with Wolfram Syndrome that it was found out that
being anxious, upset and easily agitated was all part of the condition."
Tracy said WS is a life-limiting condition, although she said Jennifer isn't
fully aware of the long-term health implications.
Jennifer's family started the Wolfram Syndrome support group in 2010, after
finding there was no support in the UK for anyone else affected by the
condition.
"Raising awareness of such a rare syndrome among the public and especially among
the medical profession is very important to us.
Many doctors have never heard of
the condition or are likely to ever come across a person affected by the
syndrome," said Tracy.
Professor Tim Barrett, Lead Wolfram Syndrome researcher in the UK, said: "At the
end of the day, the world of big pharmaceuticals and medical research is
incredibly competitive and very money driven; any number of groups could fund
this research and potentially find a life changing treatment for Wolfram
Syndrome.

Kevin and Julia Plummer want a national register
of experts in rare diseases to be created,  so that sufferers can get the care,
advice and the treatment that they need.
Their daughter Alyson died of Gitelmans
Syndrome, a kidney deficiency which  affects one in 10,000 people, but it is not
listed as a life-threatening illness.
Only about 30 people in the United Kingdom know that they have the syndrome,
which affects the kidneys and leads to a dangerously low level of potassium and
magnesium, the electrolytes that control the heart.
"When Alyson was
diagnosed, we had no idea what Gitelmans Syndrome was, but we have managed to
find three experts on the illness and she could have been referred to one of
them.
"If there was a
national register of experts on rare disease, then doctors could refer it to.

FDA Grants Soligenix Orphan Drug Designation for Dusquetide for Treatment of
Macrophage Activation Syndrome

LENGTH: 352  words


Aug. 18 -- Soligenix, Inc. (OTCQB: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a
late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing
products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced
today that the Office of Orphan Products Development of the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to the active
ingredient dusquetide for treatment of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).
Dusquetide has previously received orphan drug designation for the treatment of
acute radiation syndrome (ARS).
The US Orphan Drug Act is intended to assist and encourage companies to develop
safe and effective therapies for the treatment of rare diseases and disorders.
"Dusquetide's activity in preclinical models has demonstrated the
potential to enhance mechanisms of the innate immune system to clear infection
and modulate the inflammatory response, the critical attributes of this syndrome

TAMPONS ARE LINKED TO A RARE DISEASE

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section 1; Page 17, Column 6; Style Desk

LENGTH: 578 words

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 27


The use of tampons has been linked to a rare disease called toxic shock syndrome
that primarily affects young women, national health officials said today, but
preliminary studies show no reason for most women to discontinue tampon use.
The Center for Disease Control here reported the results of three studies of the
syndrome, a sometimes fatal disease characterized by high fever, vomiting,
diarrhea, a sunburnlike rash and a rapid drop in blood pressure, which
frequently results in shock.
Ninety-three women who had the disease were included in the three studies, which
were conducted by Federal and state health officials in Wisconsin and Utah.
Since 1978, 128 cases of toxic shock syndrome have been reported, with 10
resulting in death, the report said.
Bacterium Is Suspected

Dr. Kathryn Shands, an epidemiologist with the center, said researchers had not
determined exactly how tampon use was related to the disease.
Earlier studies
have indicated that the syndrome may be caused by a toxin associated with
Staphylococcus aureus, a common bacterium that causes pus to form in boils and
abcesses, the report said.
Dr. Shands said about 50 million American
women use tampons, but toxic shock syndrome occurs in only about three of
100,000 menstruating women each year.
Discontinuance Not Proposed
''Because we expect only a small number of women to get the disease, we are
suggesting that women not discontinue tampon use unless they have had toxic
shock syndrome already,'' she said.
Women who have had the disease should refrain from using tampons for at least
several menstrual cycles after their illness, Dr.  Shands said.
Health officials do not recommend testing for the bacterium unless a woman has
shown symptoms of toxic shock syndrome, she said.
Industry Helping Studies

No particular brand of tampon has been associated with the disease, the center
said.
Representatives of the tampon industry noted that toxic shock syndrome is
rare and said they were cooperating with the center's studies.

ProQR's Drug Candidate QRX-411 for Usher Syndrome Receives Orphan Drug
Designation from FDA and EMA

LENGTH: 673  words


July 5 -- ProQR Therapeutics N.V. (Nasdaq:PRQR) today announced that the
company's investigational drug QRX-411 has received orphan drug designation
(ODD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines
Agency (EMA) for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, including Usher syndrome
, the subtype targeted by QRX-411.
Usher syndrome is the leading cause of
combined deafness and blindness due to genetic defects in the Usher gene.
ODD in the U.S. and European Union provides a special status for investigational
drugs being developed for rare diseases.
"We are pleased with the progress we have made to date with our novel RNA based
therapeutic ophthalmology pipeline for patients suffering from genetic eye
diseases.
Securing orphan drug designations from the FDA and EMA for QRX-411 is
a milestone for the program and highlights the importance of addressing the
unmet need of this debilitating disease," said Daniel A. de Boer, CEO of ProQR,
"The severe genetic retinal diseases we are targeting do not have any available
therapies, especially disease modifying therapies focused on restoring vision or
impeding progression of the disease.
We believe our novel RNA oligonucleotide
approach has the potential to make a meaningful impact in the lives of Usher
syndrome patients and others with rare genetic eye diseases."
Chief Development Strategy Officer, David M. Rodman, MD, notes, "At ProQR we
have a unique opportunity to combine the flexibility of our oligonucleotide drug
discovery platform with accelerated drug development strategies for rare
diseases.
Orphan drug designation is an important step in rapidly bringing
transformational precision medicines to patients with Usher syndrome and many
other genetic causes of blindness in children and adults."
* QRX-411 for Usher syndrome type II due to the PE-40 mutation in the USH2A
gene, for which a clinical candidate has been selected and is ready for IND
enabling development studies.
* QRX-421 for Usher syndrome type II due to Exon 13 mutations in the USH2A gene,
for which a clinical candidate has been selected and is ready for IND enabling
development studies.
* QRX-1011 for Stargardt's disease due to c.5461-10T>C mutations in the ABCA4
gene, which is in optimization phase.
About Usher Syndrome

Usher syndrome is the leading cause of combined deafness and blindness.
Patients
with this syndrome generally progress to a stage in which they have very limited
central vision and moderate to severe deafness.
To date, there are no treatments
approved or products in clinical development that treat the vision loss
associated with the disease.
Usher syndrome Type II is one of the most common
forms of Usher syndrome and is caused by mutations in the USH2A gene.
About QRX-411

QRX-411 is a first-in-class RNA-based oligonucleotide designed to address the
underlying cause of Usher syndrome due to the c.7595-2144A>G mutation in the
USH2A gene.

Zogenix Receives Orphan Drug Designation from FDA for ZX008 in Treatment of
Lennox Gastaut Syndrome

LENGTH: 384  words


June 22 -- Zogenix, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZGNX), a pharmaceutical company developing
therapies for the treatment of orphan and central nervous system (CNS)
disorders, today announced the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has granted
its investigational drug, ZX008 (low-dose fenfluramine), orphan drug designation
for the treatment of Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), a refractory, debilitating
childhood-onset epilepsy.
The Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA follows the
European Union's granting of Orphan Drug Designation for ZX008 in the treatment
of LGS earlier this year.
"The receipt of Orphan Drug Designation in the treatment of LGS represents
another significant milestone for our ZX008 development program," said Stephen
J. Farr, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Zogenix.
We intend to initiate this clinical
trial in the second half of 2017, following the availability of top-line Phase 3
data in our initial indication, Dravet syndrome.
We expect that the first
patients will enroll in the planned LGS study in the fourth quarter of 2017."
Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development
grants Orphan Drug Designation to investigational drugs and biologics that are
intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000
people in the U.S. Orphan drug status is intended to facilitate drug development
for rare diseases and may provide several benefits to drug developers, including
assistance with clinical study design and drug development, tax credits for
qualified clinical trials costs, exemptions from certain FDA application fees,
and seven years of market exclusivity upon regulatory product approval.
Zogenix is currently conducting a Phase 3 program in the U.S. and
internationally for ZX008 in Dravet syndrome, another intractable, severe
epilepsy that begins in infancy.
ZX008 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome has
orphan designation in both the U.S. and Europe, and the development program has
received Fast Track designation in the U.S.

Tests on Lincoln's shirt may prove he had rare disease

BYLINE: By Thomson Prentice, Medical Correspondent

SECTION: Home news

LENGTH: 380 words


THE shirt that Abraham Lincoln wore on the night he was assassinated may help to
confirm that he had a rare disease that made him uncommonly tall.
Tests on bloodstains on the shirt the president wore on that fateful night at
Ford's Theatre in Washington in 1865 could show that he inherited Marfan's
syndrome, a disorder that has now been traced to a specific genetic defect.
In research published today in Nature by American, French and Japanese
scientists, the defect is identified as the probable cause of the syndrome.
Marfan's syndrome, an abnormality of the skeleton, heart and eyes, was not
recognised until 30 years after Lincoln's death, but scientists have for some
time believed that he exemplified Marfan's characteristics of unusual height,
long, thin limbs and large hands and feet, and a gaunt appearance.
''The possibility that Lincoln had Marfan's syndrome is a question worth
answering now that the means of doing so are in sight,'' Victor McKusick, an
American geneticist, says in Nature.
The Lincoln connection is bound to draw attention to the syndrome among doctors
and the general public, Dr McKusick says.
''It can do for the disorder what
poliomyelitis in President Roosevelt did for that disease.''
The research in Nature points to the fibrillin gene as the likely source of
Marfan's syndrome.

Family of child with rare disease welcomes holiday cheer

BYLINE: Aaron Weinberg, Skagit Valley Herald, Mount Vernon, Wash.
But earlier this year, he was diagnosed with a rare fatal genetic disease called
Sanfilippo syndrome.
The disease, which affects 1 in 70,000, prevents the body from breaking down
cellular waste, according to the Cure Sanfilippo Foundation.
Taci Belisle's time is spent taking Ryder to various treatments, including
speech, behavioral and occupational therapy.
Because the disease affects so few, it is not well known.
In an effort to get the word out about the disease and to raise money, Taci
Belisle started a social media campaign called #lightsforryder.
This holiday season has been difficult for the family of five, she said, as they
cope with the impacts of Ryder's disease.
He was diagnosed with autism, and after developing hearing and vision problems
was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome.
The Belisles were recently involved in a fundraising effort with the
organization, which in September sent climbers to the summit of Mount Rainier to
plant a flag with names of Sanfilippo syndrome patients.
She's also hoping to get Ryder into clinical trials for gene therapy treatment.

A WALSALL schoolgirl who is one of an estimated 20 people in the WORLD to suffer
from a rare disease has become the face of a hospital fundraising campaign.
Matilda Hatton, aged seven, has Sensenbrenner Syndrome, but she wasn't diagnosed
until she was three years old because doctors were baffled by her symptoms.
The disease means she has morphic facial features, shorter limbs and grows at a
slower rate than other children.
Little is known about the condition.
Days after Matilda was born she was rushed from Stafford Hospital to Birmingham
Children's Hospital, where she has received treatment and has been monitored
ever since.
It was there that doctors finally told Les and Michelle that they believed their
daughter had Sensenbrenner Syndrome.
Michelle added: "A woman from Canada messaged us one evening to say her child
also had Sensenbrenner Syndrome.
She puts up a front fighting off any tiredness she gets from the condition.
Now Matilda is part of the Star Appeal by Birmingham Children's Hospital, which
is aiming to raise £3.65 million to fund a rare diseases centre at the site.
Her picture will go up in Victoria Square along with 11 other youngsters who are
also suffering from a wide range of uncommon conditions next month as part of a
fundraising exhibition.
For Matilda's family, a new Rare Diseases Centre would be incredible.

A Bath woman who suffers from a rare disease is grateful that a life-saving drug
has been funded by the Government - but worries that she will not be eligible to
receive it.
Sarah Long, 44, who is thought to be one of the oldest sufferers of Morquio
Syndrome, spent last year fighting for Vimizim to be funded after her life was
turned around by a free trial of the drug.
The drug, also referred to as elosulfase alfa, is now available on the NHS for
people with the condition following a final decision by the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (Nice).
To get the drug on the NHS, patients have to show they have a proven medical
response to it by meeting five criteria set by the Government, she said.
Sarah believes that, because of the natural progression of the disease, it will
be more difficult for adults than children to show they meet the criteria set
out in the Government's "managed access agreement".
"Drugs for rare diseases such as Morquio syndrome are often very expensive and
need to be funded from an inevitably finite budget which must also fund other
patients and conditions," Mr Freeman said in a letter confirming the decision.
"Crucial to this process was the willingness of BioMarin to work with NHS
England in order to reach a deal that allows patients to access this drug
through a managed access agreement."
Bath MP Ben Howlett, who took up Sarah's fight in Parliament, said he hoped that
future decisions on the funding of drugs for rare diseases would be made more
quickly than that over Vimizim.
Mr Howlett said: "I am delighted that Nice have reached this decision, although
disappointed at the length of time and distress it has taken to patients
awaiting the outcome.
"It is clearly difficult to balance expensive treatments for a small number of
people from a finite pot of money, but in this instance the science did seem to
win the argument."
Morquio Syndrome is a disease that affects the major organ systems in the body
and people with it lack a certain enzyme.
Most people with the disease die in their teens
because of complications with their heart or lungs.

Naia Rare Diseases Appoints Professor Palle Bekker Jeppesen to Its Scientific
Advisory Board

   Jan 26, 2016

   Naia Limited, an international drug development company today announced that
its subsidiary, Naia Rare Diseases, has appointed Professor Palle Bekker
Jeppesen, MD, Head of Research at the Department of Gastroenterology,
Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, to its Scientific Advisory Board.Professor Jeppesen
is a recognized expert in the treatment of Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) and has
been a leading researcher developing new therapeutic approaches for the disease.
"We are excited that Professor Jeppesen has agreed to join
Naia Rare Diseases Scientific Advisory Board," said H. Daniel Perez, M.D.,
co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Naia Limited.
"He is an
acknowledged expert in the treatment of SBS and his addition to our already
distinguished board is a testament to the importance of what we are doing."
Naia
Rare Diseases is developing therapeutics for SBS and other rare gastrointestinal
diseases.
The company intends to file an IND for its lead program, NB 1001 in
the second quarter of 2016, and will conduct a Phase 1b open label, single dose,
dose de-escalation study in adult SBS patients in the second half of 2016.
"I believe Naia is
working on potentially significant treatments for SBS and I look forward to
working with Naia to bring these therapies to SBS patients in need."
His
major research interests include patients with short bowel syndrome and
intestinal failure with a recent focus on novel therapies for their management,
rehabilitation and care.
He
completed his PhD thesis, entitled The significance of the fatty acid
chain-length for the clinical effect in the enteral and parenteral nutrition in
patients with malabsorption in 1998 and his Doctor's Degree, entitled Intestinal
insufficiency and failure, in 2003.
Licensed from Amunix Operating Inc., NB 1001 uses Amunix's
proprietary "XTEN" technology to extend the half-life of the GLP-1 peptide and
allows for up to once-per-month dosing, thus considerably increasing convenience
for patients and caregivers.
Because of lower overall exposure and dose required
(as a replacement therapy) NB 1001 will have an increased safety window compared
to other GLP-1 agonists, important as SBS patients are a very fragile
population.
Exenatide, has been studied in patients with SBS by Dr. Pimentel and
demonstrated efficacy by slowing gastric contractions as well as bowel movements
and improving nutritional status leading to discontinuation of parenteral
nutrition.
Naia Rare Diseases a subsidiary of Naia Limited, Forms Scientific Advisory Board
Comprised of Internationally Renowned Experts and Scientists

   Jan 07, 2016

   Naia Limited, an international drug development company announced that its
subsidiary, Naia Rare Diseases, has formed a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)
comprised of internationally renowned experts and scientists in gastrointestinal
diseases, particularly Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS).Mark Pimentel, MD, FRCPC,
member of Naia's board of scientific and clinical advisors and director of the
gastrointestinal motility program and laboratory at Cedars-Sinai, is joined by
Mark DeLegge, MD, professor of medicine at the Medical University of South
Carolina, John DiBaise, MD, professor of medicine at Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale,
Arizona, Stuart Kaufman, MD, medical director, pediatric transplantation,
Georgetown Medical Center and Farooq Rahman, BSc, Ph.D., FRCP, consultant
gastroenterologist & lead physician for intestinal failure, University College
Hospital, London.
Naia also appointed Andrew Jablonski, CEO, Short Bowel
Syndrome Foundation, advisor for patient and physician relations.
"The high
caliber of Naia Rare Diseases' SAB is a clear indication of the great potential
of our rare diseases platform," said H. Daniel Perez, M.D., co-founder, chairman
and chief executive officer of Naia Limited.
Naia Rare
Diseases is developing drugs for SBS and other rare gastrointestinal diseases.
The company intends to file an IND for its lead program, NB 1001 in the second
quarter of 2016, and will conduct a Phase 1b open label, single dose, dose
de-escalation study in adult SBS patients in the second half of 2016.
"Their
dedication and expertise in treating patients with SBS is reflected by the large
number of patients they treat and their large referral base.
I look forward to
working with them to bring new and promising therapies to SBS patients in need."
"Mr. Jablonski will be
critical in our efforts to enhance Naia's interactions with SBS patients.
Understanding their needs and concerns is paramount for the successful
development of our SBS treatment, NB 1001."

Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) in collaboration with Department of
Pediatric, Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) and Pakistan Pediatric Association (PPA)
is organizing a 2-days National Conference on Rare Diseases Day to give
awareness about Genetic, Metabolic and Chromosomal disorders amongst the doctors
and general practitioners.
In the Conference, rare diseases including genetic, metabolic and chromosomal
disorders in children will be discussed.
Among
chromosomal disorders, downs syndrome is the most common one.
WHO estimates the incidence of Down syndrome to be one out of 1,000-1,100 live
births worldwide.
This Conference will provide a platform to doctors and health care
providers to update their knowledge on these diseases.

Shannon Pierce was distraught three years ago when she learned that herbaby,
Caroline, had Pierre Robin syndrome, a rare congenital disorder.
In her
desperate search for information, Ms. Pierce latched onto an increasingly common
option for people grappling with little-known diseases, an online support group.
Children with Pierre Robin syndrome are born with facial deformities like
abnormally small lower jaws and cleft palates that can hinder eating and
breathing.
According to the National Institutes of Health's Office of Rare Diseases, there
are about 6,000 ailments that afflict 200,000 or fewer Americans.
Some like
Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease and Tourette's syndrome
are relatively well known.
Now, instead of needing to expend huge amounts of time, energy and money to find
information about rare diseases, the sufferers and their relatives can turn to
the Internet, which has drastically changed their landscape in just a few years.
"If you've got cancer or arthritis, you can probably find a support group that
meets locally in a church basement," said Abbey Meyers, who is the president of
the National Organization for Rare Disorders (www.rarediseases.org) in Danbury,
Conn. "But if you have a rare disorder, you can feel very isolated.
If you get
into a chat room, you're suddenly communicating with people all over the world
who have the same disease."
Mr. Hughes is the father of two young
boys with X-linked alpha-thalassemia mental retardation syndrome.
When he realized that many individuals and families coping with other unusual
ailments lacked similar support, he created the International Rare Disease
Support Network (www.raredisorders.com), which links people to more than 1,000
online groups for specific disorders.
Because only a small part of
government and other research funds are spent on disorders that affect few
people, patients' advocates use the Web sites to raise money, lobby officials
and drive the research agenda for the particular illnesses, all at a small
fraction of the cost of printing and mailing letters and brochures.
Dr. Ratner established her group after learning 20 years ago that she had the
disease, an inflammation of the bladder wall that affects mostly women.
It can
cause excruciating pain and a constant sensation of having to urinate, but
treatment options are limited.
In addition to a list of support groups, the association's Web site,
www.ichelp.com, includes reports from scientific conferences; information on
clinical trials; articles on coping with the disease; summaries of studies in
peer-review journals; profiles of patients and interviews with them; online
surveys, including a current one on how it affects sexual activity; recipes for
restricted diets; and unusual but useful tips like ways to grow low-acid
tomatoes and where to buy the seeds.
In 1999, Phil and Tricia Milto learned that their son Nathan, who was then 4,
had late infantile Batten disease, an extremely rare genetic syndrome that leads
to blindness, mental deterioration, the loss of motor skills and, ultimately,
death.
The Miltos, whose youngest son, P. J., also has the disease, formed the Nathan's
Battle Foundation and worked on the organization's Web site,
www.nathansbattle.com, to plan scientific gatherings, promote promising
treatment possibilities and raise money for gene therapy and stem cell research.
The symptoms of glycogen storage disease, a hereditary illness
that involves the inability to metabolize sugars properly, can vary widely and
may mimic other disorders, Ms. Swain said.
"These are people who haven't
felt well, and they're perusing whatever kind of diseases may be out there.

Poor awareness of rare diseases is risking lives, according to the ChiefMedical
Officer's annual report, Sam Lister writes

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.
Katy discovered during the trip, in the summer of 2005, that she was one of more
than three million Britons who suffer from some kind of rare disease -
conditions that, too often, are not identified until the patient is in critical
care or even dead.
In his annual report Sir Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer, will warn
today of the alarming lack of awareness and effective services for rare
diseases.
It will highlight how children are dying needlessly, having lived for
years with undiagnosed or misdiagnosed conditions.
Speaking to The Times, Sir Liam, who steps down in May after 12 years in his
post, said that there was an urgent need for more understanding and funding of
more than 6,000 rare diseases.
Defined as occurring in fewer than five in every
10,000 people, the conditions are usually chronic and often start in childhood.
They include neurological and metabolic disorders, cancers, muscle diseases and
heart defects.
"These are the Cinderella conditions," Sir Liam told The Times.
Control of the condition is straightforward: dietary monitoring and regular
meals, and glucose drinks if the person falls ill.
Four other conditions-
cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anaemia, phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism-are
also covered.
But for most rare diseases no such test is available.
Sir Liam's recommendations will include a national clinical director for rare
diseases to oversee the development of clear standards and approaches to
treatment, particularly to address problems encountered by sufferers moving from
child to adult services.
Carol Dezateux, of the Institute of Child Health, University
College London, said that while rare diseases varied, most were chronic and
incurable and caused a deterioration of health.
Information could be hard to get, and the average GP may have never encountered
the particular condition when a patient turned up, Professor Dezateux added.
But I do feel that
there's an issue about getting a timely diagnosis: there's a problem when you
don't consider rare diseases when the other things have been discounted.
Almost half of people with a rare disease have difficulty in getting a correct
diagnosis, often because of poor access to specialists, research suggests.
The
European Organisation for Rare Diseases found that more than a third of cases of
Duchenne muscular dystrophy are initially misdiagnosed and almost 40 per cent of
cases of Fragile X syndrome, where a gene on the X chromosome responsible for
brain development is faulty, causing mental retardation.
One in three cases of
Prader Willi syndrome, a chromosomal disorder with symptoms that include
learning difficulties, obesity and behavioural problems, is also likely to be
misdiagnosed.
She said that for rare diseases where early identification can prevent
irreversible damage, screening is vital, but future advances in testing needed
to be weighed carefully.
"If you are a parent being told that your healthy baby
has a condition that could occur in 15 years, and which you can't do anything
about, it can overshadow many years that could otherwise have been happy."
For other conditions, noticing symptoms and access to treatment will remain the
priority, with an accurate collation of case information in national registers.
For Katy Frost, the traumatic diagnosis of a rare disease has been overcome.
She keeps a
close eye on her condition, and when feeling ill knows to get the
glucose-normally a Ribena from the fridge.
I was always moody

Researchers at the Hospital for Sick Children and St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital in Tennessee have pinpointed the gene that causes a rare and fatal form
of childhood leukemia.
Lead author Dr. Hans Hitzler hopes the discovery will help science figure out
how to treat the disease, which does not respond well to conventional cancer
therapies.
Those are rare diseases," Hitzler said in an interview.
"But there's ample precedent that rare diseases often teach us a great deal
about the mechanism of a disease.
Studying the disease has not been easy.
It's so rare that hospitals like Sick
Kids may see only one case a year.
The disease strikes children with Down's syndrome and infants, usually under 18
months of age.
The disease is different in children with Down's syndrome, and chemotherapy
works better in those cases.
And researchers have been given a road map for the disease.
Such a therapy promises to be much easier to tolerate than traditional cancer
treatments such as chemotherapy.

PAULINE Johnston knows all about the symptoms of the rare Guillian-Barre
syndrome after suffering from it herself, so when her daughter Megan called her
in tears describing her symptoms, Pauline told her to get to a doctor
immediately.
Fifteen years ago after a stressful year and overcoming a nasty flu, Pauline was
diagnosed with the autoimmune syndrome.
The syndrome first took Pauline's ability to move her arms, then it was her
knees and shortly afterwards she lost everything.
"A lot of people think the syndrome is a virus," she said.
By Thursday, the syndrome had crept all through Pauline's body, rendering her
incapable of any movement.
"What the syndrome does is when you have a virus, your immune system works to
get rid of it, like usual," she said.
Megan was flown to hospital herself where she was also diagnosed with
Guillian-Barre syndrome.
"Before the syndrome she was a very full-on girl, couldn't stand just being in
bed all day," Pauline said.
"But she is receiving treatment to aid her in recovery, something that wasn't
around 15 years ago."
Guillian-Barre syndrome is not hereditary and you cannot catch it from another
person.
According to Brain Foundation Australia, the syndrome usually follows after a
bacterial or viral infection.
Both Pauline and Megan are still looking for the answers, and said they would
volunteer for DNA testing of the syndrome, should the opportunity arise.
"Anyone in the world could get it, what happened to me and my daughter could
happen to anyone, even if it is a rare disease."

Ontario offers help for women with rare disease

Health Minister Eric Hoskins says he's been moved by the stories of two young
Ontario women with a rare disorder and wants to find ways to help them medically
and financially.
Erika Crawford, 20, of Brantford and Brooklyn Mills, 22, of Oakville, both
suffer from Ehlers Danois Syndrome, or EDS, a genetic defect in the connective
tissue that provides supports to many body parts including skin, muscles and
ligaments.
It leads to severe dislocations, chronic pain, heart problems, mobility issues,
lost vision, severe fatigue and a poor quality of life, and is so hard to
diagnose that few doctors have the knowledge to properly treat patients.
Hoskins met with the two women and their parents Wednesday and said he created a
panel of experts to look at ways to help them and others with rare diseases like
Ehlers Danois Syndrome.
"I've lost track of how many times my daughter has been labelled psychosomatic
because doctors in Ontario do not have the necessary training or experience to
treat this disease," he said.
"It's bad enough having such a horrible, disability disease, but to have doctors
tell you you have manifested the symptoms in your head is just cruel and
inhumane."
People like Erika and Brooklyn with EDS are caught in a "bizarre catch-22, where
they can't get treatment in Ontario while the Ministry of Health fails to cover
treatment out of the province," said Progressive Conservative MPP Michael
Harris.
He introduced a petition in the legislature calling for funding of out
of province treatment for EDS patients.

Rare disease strikes family MELBOURNE: Charlie and Sylvia Webb have five
children _ three of whom have the rarest genetic disease in Australia.
The
children Jade, 9, Tegan 7, and Lucas, 6, have Leroy I-Cell Syndrome.
They are
among only 10 Australian children who have the condition and are believed to be
the only three still living.
They have all passed normal life expectancy for the
disease.
Symptoms of Leroy I-Cell Syndrome are stunted growth,
limited joint movement, enlarged liver and spleen, heart abnormalities,
recurrent ear and chest infection and susceptibility to any illness.
The Gold Coast two-year-old has Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a condition so rare it
affects only 170 people worldwide.
Parents Catherine Harris, 40, and Michael Harris, 39, face the daunting costs of
caring for a child with such a rare disease.
Her parents hoped her development delays were due to the premature birth but she
was diagnosed with the syndrome at 18 months.
February 29 is Rare -Disease Day Australia and a fundraising event is being held
in Brisbane on Saturday.

Jul.
Their two sons both have a rare genetic
disorder known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.
Dr. William Nyhan, professor of pediatrics at the University of California-San
Diego School of Medicine, who along with medical student Michael Lesch, first
characterized the disease in 1964.
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome stems from an enzyme deficiency and is characterized by a
buildup of uric acid in bodily fluids that leads to symptoms such as severe
gout, poor muscle control, moderate retardation and self-mutilating behaviors
such as finger and lip biting.
He has a condition
the doctors call malignant hyperthermia, a condition in which he can make

X4 Pharmaceuticals Announces Rare Disease Research Collaboration with Yale
University

LENGTH: 755  words


Aug. 2 -- X4 Pharmaceuticals, a clinical stage biotechnology company developing
novel CXCR4 inhibitor drugs to improve immune cell trafficking to treat cancer
and rare diseases, today announced the initiation of a multi-year sponsored
research program with Yale University to develop and study a genetic model of
WHIM syndrome, a rare genetic immunodeficiency disease which currently has no
approved treatments.
The multi-year research collaboration will investigate the fundamental
mechanisms that result in chronic immune deficiency in a genetic preclinical
model of WHIM syndrome.
"X4's research program with Yale offers the exciting possibility
to gain mechanistic insights into WHIM syndrome and the role that CXCR4 plays
broadly in immunity, so that we can further demonstrate the potential of our
drug candidate, X4P-001-RD, to address the unmet need of patients with WHIM
syndrome."
About WHIM Syndrome

WHIM syndrome is a primary genetic immunodeficiency disease caused by mutations
in the CXCR4 receptor gene resulting susceptibility to certain infections.
WHIM
is an abbreviation for the characteristic symptoms of the syndrome: Warts,
Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis.
Within the overall
category of primary immunodeficiencies, there are between 15,000 and 100,000
patients in the US that are classified with disease of unknown origin - of which
WHIM is one of these diseases of unknown origin.
The precise prevalence of
patients that have the genetic mutation responsible for WHIM syndrome is
unknown, but we estimate that several thousand patients worldwide suffer from
WHIM syndrome.
Because patients are highly susceptible to infections, WHIM
syndrome is associated with significant morbidity beginning in early childhood
and continuing throughout life.
Current therapy is limited to treatment of acute
infections with antibiotics or prevention through the use of intravenous
immunoglobulin.
There is no approved therapy for the treatment of WHIM syndrome.
About X4P-001-RD for Primary Genetic Immunodeficiency Disease

X4P-001-RD, an oral, small molecule inhibitor of CXCR4, or C-X-C receptor type
4, is being developed for use as a life-long treatment for patients with WHIM
syndrome and other primary genetic immunodeficiencies.
X4P-001-RD is currently
being studied in a Phase 2/3 trial in patients with WHIM syndrome.
In patients with WHIM syndrome,
mutations to the CXCR4 receptor cause aberrant signaling leading to retention of
neutrophils and leukocytes in the bone marrow and inadequate immune surveillance
and function.
Mutations in the chemokine
receptor gene CXCR4 are associated with WHIM syndrome, a combined
immunodeficiency disease.

AS part of Rare Disease Day the Gazette is sharing the story of a two-year-old
from Dursley who has a one in ten million syndrome.
Isaac Mansell has the neurological disorder called Opsoclonus Myoclonus Syndrome
(OMS), which was caused by a cancerous tumour which was removed from his abdomen
on May 4 2016 and removed 13 days later.
Isaac's condition has caused his body's immune system to go into overdrive and
produces an response which attacks the brain as well as the tumour.
OMS is a life-long condition that Isaac will never be rid of completely, but
with continued treatment he can regain many of his abilities - he recently
walked down the stairs in their Dursley home, a massive achievement.
The couple first noticed signs of the syndrome when Isaac began to fall over
more regularly than usual - he had been able to walk from 10 months.
A CT scan revealed nothing and a further MRI and lumbar puncture were then
scheduled to give a definite answer for Isaac's symptoms which once suspected to
be encephalitis was confirmed as the one in ten million condition,
Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome.

Patients with rare diseases will continue to suffer and spend their life savings
on treatments after the Ontario government turned down a chance to help them, a
Newmarket father with a debilitating illness says.
He's worried the government's decision could mean "people with rare diseases
will die and/or go further into debt".
But while opposition politicians, including Thornhill MPP Gila Martow and
York-Simcoe MPP Julia Munro, are slamming the Liberals, Newmarket-Aurora MPP
Chris Ballard said his government is going beyond what came before the
legislature last week to help patients with rare diseases.

Newmarket man with rare disease must battle system for coverage March 2, 2016

The committee would have looked at ways to better diagnose and treat rare
diseases that strike one in 12 Ontario residents.
It is unfair people with rare diseases are often left to fund their own
treatments while patients with diseases such as cancer are covered by OHIP, he
said.
Harris said he came up with his private member's bill after watching patients
and their families come to Queen's Park to beg the government for help covering
the cost of their treatments.
After eight years of suffering progressively worsening symptoms, Green was
diagnosed last November with Erdheim-Chester disease.
He is one of only seven known Canadians today and one of only about 500
worldwide ever diagnosed with the disease, which causes severe muscle
co-ordination problems, slurred speech, organ failure and other symptoms.
Green has just started taking a medication usually given to cancer patients.
While Health Minister Eric Hoskins' announcement last week to establish a clinic
for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a step in the right direction, the committee would
have given patients and their families the ear of politicians, who are able to
legislate a difference, Pape-Green said.
"Michael Harris' passionate speech showed with every word he said how he was
listening to people with rare diseases," she said, adding her family and others
will continue to advocate on the issue.
"Genetic tests and biopsies were conclusive for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and Mitch
is now an advocate for many Canadian sufferers.
By not properly supporting
patients with rare diseases, we are failing to provide the necessary support,
ensure early diagnosis and provide affordable treatment."
As many patients with rare diseases and their families watched at the
legislature, it was "heart-breaking" to see the motion for the committee fail,
Martow said.
However, Ballard said his government is taking action that will help patients
more than Harris' failed motion.
Hoskins has already announced a working group to look into issues surrounding
rare diseases, including improving diagnoses and treatments for patients and
better co-ordinating services, Ballard said.
What Minister Hoskins is doing is actually working on
solutions," he said, adding the Ehlers-Danlos clinic will serve as a model for
addressing other rare diseases.
But Harris and Munro argue the government's refusal to set up the committee was
a blow to patients with rare diseases.
"I can't help but tell you directly I feel this government, the Liberals, have
turned their backs on people with a rare disease," he said.
The current system means patients with rare diseases are often left to fend for
themselves rather than being able to rely on a standard system, Munro said.

Rare disease turns skin "hard as stone"

BYLINE: David Olinger

SECTION: ASECTION; Pg.
Jaiden had been diagnosed with stiff skin syndrome, an extremely rare and
incurable disease.
For the unlucky few, rare diseases come with a special curse.
Natalie and Tim know of one doctor, at Johns Hopkins Children's
Center, who is studying stiff skin syndrome.
Because the disease is so rare, its diagnosis and prognosis can be unclear.
The
Johns Hopkins doctor, Hal Dietz, said about a dozen families in the world have
been confirmed to carry the gene for stiff skin syndrome, which sometimes gets
confused with a deadlier, similar disease: scleroderma.
Chemotherapy slowed the disease, but his parents stopped that recently because
his fingers grew numb.
For Jaiden, physical pain is not the worst part of his disease.
Stiff skin syndrome?
Pence examines his new areas of skin disease a shoulder, his lower back.
"I think the hard part is it's such a rare disease," she said.
At Johns Hopkins, Dietz said stiff skin syndrome also is difficult to diagnose
and confirmable only by a DNA test for the gene that causes it.
Dietz said stiff
skin syndrome often gets confused with scleroderma, which also produces tight,
hard skin but can kill the victim by invading internal organs.
In some ways, Jaiden's disease looks more like scleroderma because, Dietz said,
stiff skin syndrome tends to show up at birth.
Dietz rues that federal research dollars have been declining for such diseases.
He said cholesterol medicine users, for instance, can thank a breakthrough
originating with rare disease research.
"I see a worrisome trend in that rare disorders are not getting the same amount
of funding," he said.
"I think rare disorders have taken a hit over the last
decade or so."
Jaiden had been born with fetal alcohol syndrome.
Tim hopes the disease can be stabilized enough to enable Jaiden to hold a
homebound computer job as an adult.
Jaiden is a 10-year-old boy with stiff skin syndrome, one of 41 kids in
the world known to have the disease.
His bat and baggy green hung up for good, Waugh's latest challenge is to run in
The Sun-Herald City2Surf, presented by Westpac, accompanied by fellow Team Waugh
members who are fund-raising for children with rare diseases.
"We had a small [foundation] team of 30 or 40 and it made me think 'this
has the potential to get bigger' - to raise awareness of the Steve Waugh
Foundation, raise money for children with rare diseases and have a great day
out."
There are 8000 known rare diseases - those that occur in one in 10,000 or more
people - and the foundation estimates they affect about 200,000 Australian
children.
"The boys have Arts syndrome, which is a rare genetic disease causing hearing
and sight impairment, muscle weakness, mental disability and increased risk of
infection and they are the only two kids alive in Australia, and possibly the
world, with this condition," Waugh said.
"It took their parents nine years to
get a diagnosis and the life expectancy of kids with Arts syndrome is only about
10 years."

ArQule Announces Collaboration with NIH for Clinical Development of ARQ 092 in
Proteus Syndrome

LENGTH: 807  words


Washington, D.C.: Biotechnology Industry Organization has issued the following
news release:

Agreement builds upon pre-clinical data showing shutdown of AKT signaling and
reduction of cell viability

ArQule, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARQL) today announced an agreement with the National Human
Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
providing for the clinical development of ARQ 092, an orally available,
selective small molecule inhibitor of AKT, in Proteus syndrome, a rare disease
characterized by overgrowth of the skeleton, skin, adipose tissue and central
nervous system.
The NIH Proteus syndrome team is led by researchers who originally discovered
the somatic single (point) mutation in the AKT 1 oncogene that causes Proteus
syndrome1.
Results from that pre-clinical
research recently presented by the NIH team at the 2014 meeting of the American
Society of Human Genetics (ASHG, Abstract # 2180M2) demonstrate that treatment
with ARQ 092 caused a rapid shutdown of AKT signaling and a reduction in the
viability of Proteus syndrome cells taken from patients compared to untreated
diseased cells.
"This collaboration provides the opportunity to clinically investigate the
therapeutic impact of ARQ 092 in a rare, genetic disorder that has no approved
therapy and for which the only current treatment is surgery," said Dr. Leslie G.
Biesecker, M.D., Chief of the Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch at
the National Human Genome Research Institute.
"We believe the goal of treatment
for Proteus syndrome will be early diagnosis and administration of therapy over
years to mitigate the abnormal cell signaling initiated by the point mutation."
"The need for medical treatment of Proteus syndrome is high," said Brian
Schwartz, M.D., chief medical officer of ArQule.
"Characterized by non-cancerous
overgrowths of tissue, Proteus syndrome is the first non-oncology rare
indication to enter clinical testing for ARQ 092.
We are hopeful that
intervention in a single aberrant pathway responsible for this disease may hold
potential for a therapeutic advance."
About Proteus Syndrome

According to the patient advocacy and support group, the Proteus syndrome
Foundation (http://www.proteus-syndrome.org/), the condition was named for
Proteus, the Greek god who could transform his shape.
Although patients may have minimal or no manifestations
at birth, the disease develops and becomes apparent in early childhood (6-18
months) and rapidly progresses with intense growth in the first ten years of
life.
It is primarily a childhood-onset disease but there are very few living
affected adults.
Proteus syndrome is a rare condition with an incidence of less than 1 in 1
million people worldwide.
At this time, there are more than 120 documented cases
worldwide, but because not all cases are documented, it is not known how many
individuals have this syndrome.
The incidence of Proteus syndrome classifies it
as a rare disorder, defined by the National Organization of Rare Diseases (NORD)
as any disease affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans.
ARQ 092, the lead compound in ArQule's AKT program, has completed Phase 1a
clinical testing and has advanced into Phase 1b expansion testing in cohorts of
patients with endometrial cancer, lymphoma and tumors harboring either AKT or
PI3K mutations.

Oct. 15--Matt Kilpo, the speedy quarterback who helped Duluth East High School
battle to its first-ever state tournament appearance in 2007, now is battling a
rare bacterial disease in a Duluth hospital.
Kilpo, 19, now a University of Minnesota sophomore studying environmental
science, became ill in recent weeks and eventually was diagnosed with Lemierre's
syndrome.
He has been diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome; this is very
rare, but he is in good hands at the hospital."
Experts say the disease usually strikes otherwise healthy patients,
predominantly men between the ages of 15 and 30, with a complex infection.
While
patients usually respond well to early antibiotics, the problem is that many
patients don't seek care soon enough.
Moreover, most doctors rarely, if ever,
see the disease and thus don't always diagnose it quickly.
Medical literature says the disease is believed to strike fewer than one in a
million people.
But there have been five cases at St. Luke's hospital alone in
recent years, said Dr. Linda Van Etta, a St. Luke's infectious disease expert.
Lemierre's syndrome was formally identified in 1936 but nearly vanished by the
1960s, thanks to widespread use of antibiotics like penicillin to treat sore
throats, where the disease often first appears.
The disease caused an
abscess in her brain.
"All of our patients [with Lemierre's] have survived,'' Van Etta said.
"We've
come a long way since Dr. Lemierre lost 18 of his 20 patients."

Matthew seeks support from US sufferers of rare disease Charity funds
fact-finding trip for brave teenager with genetic disorder BY DAVID ALCOCK
BRAVE: Matthew Wildsmith has one of the world's rarest illnesses and is
travelling to the US to meet others with the same condition Picture: Clare
LewisA BRAVE teenager who has undergone many operations for a rare illness is
set fora unique meeting with fellow sufferers in America.
Matthew Wildsmith, from Cross Heath, Newcastle, is believed to be one of only
100 people with Langer-Giedeon Syndrome worldwide o and one of only three in
this country.
But the
illness was not diagnosed until Matthew was 11-years-old because it is so rare.
Angela said: "At the moment, we are very much in the dark about the syndrome,
but we are hoping that what we find out we can pass on to Matthew's doctors so
they have a better understanding of how to help him.
"We have been told the life expectancy for someone with his type of
Langer-Giedeon Syndrome is not normally beyond 30.
"Even the patients have taken part in raffles."
Matthew is unlucky in that he has the worst type of the
syndrome, which has left him battling physical and learning difficulties.
But mum got funding and converted a room in our house
as a treatment area.
"Now we have been presented with this brilliant opportunity for Matthew and
ourselves to try to learn as much as we can to understand the treatments needed
and what we can do to help.

Rare Disease Communications: Disease Awareness Initiative Launched for Familial
Chylomicronemia Syndrome

LENGTH: 589  words


May 14 -- Rare Disease Communications (publisher of Rare Disease Report) has
launched a disease awareness initiative to educate U.S. physicians about a rare
condition called Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS).
The Web site, http://fcs.raredr.com/, is designed to increase FCS awareness
among healthcare professionals (HCPs), to educate them on the early signs and
symptoms of FCS, and to stress the importance of patients adhering to a strict
low-fat diet.
Rare Disease Communications developed content for the site.
FCS is a very rare hereditary condition in which those affected lack a properly
functioning, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme that clears triglycerides from
plasma.
In the new FCS Disease Awareness Initiative, clinicians can learn more
about:

* Genetics, prevalence, and natural history of FCS

* Clinical signs and symptoms of FCS

* Treatment options available to lower the risk of pancreatitis

* Resources available to clinicians treating patients with FCS, including
information about patient registries, references to over 30 peer-reviewed
articles, and a video library.
Early recognition is important for this very rare condition.
An
FCS registry is also available to better understand the natural history of this
condition.
"We are delighted to announce the launch of the FCS Disease Awareness
Initiative," said Peter Ciszewski, President of Rare Disease Communications,
Plainsboro, N.J. "Hopefully, this initiative will raise awareness of this silent
disease and bring attention to the patient registry that can help us better
understand the natural history of this disease."
"The mission of Rare Disease Report is to raise awareness of orphan conditions
so that patients will be diagnosed and treated more efficiently.
This website
fulfills that mission," said James Radke, Vice President of Editorial at Rare
Disease Communications, adding, "The website educates endocrinologists, GPs,
lipidologists, and others about FCS so that when they see a patient with
unexplained pancreatitis or a creamy blood sample, they will be better prepared
to suspect FCS and run the proper diagnostic tests."
"Web sites likes this one are what Rare Disease Communications does best.
Currently, the
standard of care for FCS patients is a very low fat diet (= 15% by calories), in
which patients consume less than 20-25 grams of fat per day.
However, most
patients find it very difficult to adhere to such a diet.

Family wins drug-cost coverage; Province will fund treatment of girl's rare
medical condition

St. Albert father Dane Sadownyk picked up his threeyear-old daughter Aleena and
"just hugged her" Monday morning when the family learned the Alberta government
will fund a crucial treatment for her rare medical condition.
Aleena's family and their supporters have been lobbying Alberta Health for a
month to approve treatment for Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome, a rare disease that
means she lacks glycosaminoglycan, an enzyme that helps break down cellular
waste.
Without treatment,
sufferers see their life expectancy cut short.
Four other provinces have agreed to
fund the treatment for seven children with the syndrome - also known as
mucopolysaccharidosis type VI or MPS VI - and Aleena's family was pushing
Alberta to quickly approve the expensive but critical treatment, which is
expected to initially cost about $300,000 a year.
Andrew McFayden, director of the Isaac Foundation, went
through a similar struggle in Ontario when his son Isaac was diagnosed with MPS
VI as a toddler and was the first to receive treatment in Canada.
But McFayden also said the happiness is mixed with frustration that it took so
long and that the family's supporters felt they had to mount a public campaign
with the support of MLAs such as Wildrose health critic Heather Forsyth, after
the family's original funding application through the Alberta Rare Disease
Program was denied.
"To me, that's a big problem there still hasn't been a process put in place by
Health Canada for provinces to deal with funding these rare diseases," McFayden
said.
Health Minister Fred Horne said Monday he signed off on the funding for Aleena's
treatment through Alberta's Short Term Evaluative Drug Therapy program, instead
of the Rare Disease program, because Aleena's case involves a drug not licensed
for sale in Canada.
Horne said he weighed several factors, including the clinical evidence, the
rarity of the disease, affordability of the drug and the best interest of the
patient.
Horne said he plans to talk about the need for an orphan drug program - a term
used to describe medications for rare diseases - with other provincial health
ministers and federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose.
Forsyth, MLA for Calgary-Fish Creek, said Alberta Health must work to make the
provincial system easier to navigate for families who suddenly find themselves
seeking help with a rare condition.
With Aleena's funding approved, the Sadownyks' next learning curve will be tied
to her treatment.

Heartbroken family of terminally-ill Paulsgrove girl say funding change will
condemn her to death'

BYLINE: Tom Cotterill

LENGTH: 644  words


A HEARTBROKEN family of a little girl with a rare terminal disease is this
morning begging the NHS not to cut funding to potentially life-saving research.
Determined nine-year-old Maddison Crockford-Reid has such a rare condition -
Sanfilippo Syndrome - that there is no cure.
However, in a fresh blow the NHS and the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) revealed they will no longer stump out cash for the most
costly treatments, as of Saturday, April 1.
Having this funding is a massive glimmer of hope for both our families and
families affected by rare diseases.
In the UK there are only 24 people affected by Sanflippo Syndrome, with a mere
handful having the same ultra-rare version of the condition Maddi has.
This would effectively be leaving the disease to simply take it course' and thus
leaving her no hope or chance of survival.'
The move will see an introduction of a £100,000 quality-adjusted life year'
threshold for medicines evaluated as part of NICE's highly specialised
technologies programme, which assesses treatments for ultra-rare diseases like
Maddi's.
Campaigners say this threshold would stop the flow of expensive new medicines
reaching patients most desperately in need, with most treatments costing upwards
of £500,000.
However, charity leaders claim this is a small price to pay to give the few
families in Britain, coping with ultra-rare illnesses, extra time with their
loved ones.
Speaking to The News last night, Mrs Lavery said: To penalise these families and
children for the misfortune to have these rare diseases is incomprehensible.
Being born with an ultra-rare disease, a disease affecting less than 110 people
in England, is not a lifestyle choice; it is no-one's fault; it happens albeit
very rarely; it happened to my son.
At that time, there was no treatment and
Simon died aged seven years.
I can only imagine now how it might be to be faced with a child with an ultra-
rare disease who could be treated with a highly-specialised medicine but is
denied treatment on cost grounds.
Four-year-old Trey suffers from Hunter syndrome, an extremely rare
enzyme-deficiency disorder, that if left untreated, would twist his hands into
claws, cause his joints to seize up, obscure his sight and hearing, and
eventually kill him sometime in his teens or 20s.
But Trey and his family have the good fortune to live in British Columbia, where
our medical system offers a treatment for the disease.
Mom Deb Purcell said that in the year since Trey started the therapy,
the progressive symptoms of his disease have virtually stopped in their tracks.
But not all Canadian provinces have agreed to cover Elaprase treatments, which
cost about half a million dollars each year for one child, and can run as high
as a million dollars a year for a teenager.
At least 10 children in Ontario
suffer from Hunter syndrome, but their province's health ministry refuses to
fund treatment for it.
The review said that the drug hadn't been
tested on enough patients to prove its worth.
Canada's patchwork policy on drugs like Elaprase has led North Vancouver Liberal
MP Don Bell to introduce a private member's motion urging the federal government
to look into creating a nationwide policy on testing and funding drugs to treat
rare diseases, something that moms like Purcell believe is long overdue.
- - -

Trey was diagnosed with Hunter syndrome two years ago.
As a baby, he'd had an
umbilical hernia, a sign of the disease that nonetheless is fairly common among
healthy children.
But during a search for a new pediatrician, the Purcells ran into one doctor who
had some experience with disorders like Hunter syndrome.
A big head and enlarged organs are key
indicators of the disease.
That doctor recommended that Trey visit UBC's biochemical disease clinic.
Hunter syndrome is medically known as mucopolysaccharidosis II, or MPS II.
All of the diseases in the MPS family are passed genetically from parents to
their children.
Both mom and dad must be carriers, and each of their children
has a one in four chance of having the disease.
Hunter syndrome, on the other hand is passed down through the mother's sex
chromosomes.
That means that every son of a Hunter syndrome carrier has a 50 per
cent chance of getting sick.
Thankfully, Trey's little brother Avery tested negative for the disease as an
infant, and because Hunter syndrome is X-linked, his baby sister Sadie has
virtually no chance of inheriting the disorder.
Drugs like Elaprase work by continuously replacing the enzymes missing in MPS
patients, clearing up stockpiles of mucopolysaccharides.
The
protein is then isolated and then injected weekly into patients," Clarke said.
Elaprase has only been available to patients for three years now, so doctors
aren't yet able to predict how it will affect the long-term prognoses of
children suffering from Hunter syndrome.
"The drugs are not a cure, at this point, but they definitely modulate the
disease," Clarke said.
"It was a huge day in our life, the first day that he got the treatment, and we
knew that it would halt the progression of the disease," Harkins said.
Harkins is the president of the Canadian MPS Society, and she's been
instrumental in lobbying provincial governments to provide enzyme replacement
therapy for MPS patients.
Her protests at the Ontario health minister's officer
no doubt influenced that province to begin providing Aldurazyme for MPS I
patients.
"It is exhausting to not only have to go through the diagnosis of a child with a
rare disease .
and then, on top of that, to expect the family to fight and
fight and fight for a treatment that then becomes available.
I'm still absolutely astounded that governments will refuse to
fund these kinds of treatments for kids who will die without them," Harkins
said.
Fellow MPS mom Purcell pointed out the contrast between the Canadian medical
system's approaches to cancer and rare diseases.
"If a parent finds out that their kid has cancer, they just go right in and
start treatment.
They're able to deal with the disease and the repercussions of
that, and they don't have to fight to get treatment," Purcell said.
Both mothers said they're pleased that MP Bell has taken the lead in developing
a national policy for dealing with rare diseases.
Bell's motion, which will enter a second hour of debate on May 6, and will be
voted on May 7, calls for the government to look into a specific fund for drugs
to treat rare diseases.
It also asks for standards for conducting clinical
trials using only a small number of patients.
Typical drug trials involve
thousands of patients, but it's only possible to test each MPS drug on fewer
than 100 people.
Bell knows firsthand how rare diseases can affect families, and how important it
is to support research into treatment.
It's hard enough for a
family to deal with a family member's disease.
When you add to that there are
problems getting treatments that are available.
"The disease appears to be progressing faster than the politicians can make
decisions," he said.
They'll be raising money through a silent auction and raffles for prizes
including Canucks club tickets, a weekend at a cabin in Pender Harbour, WestJet
flights and spa treatments.
Her family created the research fund
because they wanted to build an incentive for researchers to concentrate on rare
diseases like Trey's.

A brave little girl is battling a debilitating disease so rare that it has
affected just 20 other people in the world.
Matilda Hatton, aged seven, from Walsall, has Sensenbrenner Syndrome.
The disease means she has morphic facial features, shorter limbs and grows at a
slower rate than other children.
Little is known about the condition, reports the Birmingham Mail.
Days after Matilda was born she was rushed from Stafford Hospital to Birmingham
Children's Hospital, where she has received treatment and has been monitored
ever since.
It was there that doctors finally told Les and Michelle that they believed their
daughter had Sensenbrenner Syndrome.
Michelle added: "A woman from Canada messaged us one evening to say her child
also had Sensenbrenner Syndrome.
She puts up a
front fighting off any tiredness she gets from the condition.
Now Matilda is part of the Star Appeal by Birmingham Children's Hospital, which
is aiming to raise £3.65 million to fund a rare diseases centre at the site.
Her picture will go up in Victoria Square along with 11 other youngsters who are
also suffering from a wide range of uncommon conditions next month as part of a
fundraising exhibition.
For Matilda's family a new Rare Diseases Centre would be incredible.

DATELINE: TORONTO


The Ontario government said Monday that it is improving access to specialized
care for people living with rare diseases.
Health Minister Eric Hoskins announced the opening of a new clinic for people
with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and the expansion of clinics for those with
inherited metabolic disorders and red blood cell disorders in Toronto.
Health Minister Eric Hoskins announced the opening of a new clinic for people
with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and the expansion of clinics for those with
inherited metabolic disorders and red blood cell disorders in Toronto.
"People living with these rare and complicated diseases face challenges on a
daily basis and our government is committed to providing the services and
supports that they require," said Hoskins.
"These clinics are another example of
how Ontario is putting patients first to provide them with better access to high
quality of care closer to home."
It will give primary care providers a single point of
contact to get information on signs of the disease, receive advice and feedback
from experts on diagnosis and treatment options and make referrals to
specialists.
"I believe this clinic is going to make a difference in the lives of both adult
and pediatric patients," Hoskins said.
The other clinics, to help patients with red blood disorders and metabolic
disorders, also will be in the University Health Network.
The government defines a rare disease as a life-threatening or chronically
debilitating illness that affects approximately five people out of 10,000 and
requires special, combined efforts to enable patients to be diagnosed and
treated effectively.

I COULD NOT STOP EATING;
Rare condition meant Aneeba wolfed down BOTTLE of ketchup, block of butter and
spoonfuls of SALT... and still wanted more

BYLINE: ANUJI VARMA

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.
Because Aneeba, now 23, from Erdington, suffers from a rare disease called
Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (LMBBS).
Others are not so lucky and are still battling the strange syndrome.
The student was diagnosed from an early age with LMBBS - an inherited genetic
condition that affects approximately one in 100,000 babies.
For up until the age of 13, there was a risk that Aneeba had another closely
related disease which sees patients deteriorate rapidly around the age of 11.
She is one of thousands of patients with rare diseases treated at the Queen
Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham every year.
For many of the patients, their conditions are so complex that they need to see
a number of different specialists at different dates and at different sites
round the UK.
The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham Charity is raising £1 million to create
a Rare Diseases Centre at the hospital.
The idea is that as well as creating a
place that will allow experts to share their knowledge more easily, patients
will benefit by being able to have all their appointments on the same day rather
than spread out through the year.
By holding one-day clinics, the centre will
also enable families to meet others with the same condition and share
experiences and knowledge.
Sarah Borrows, Clinical Nurse Specialist Renal Genetics, who cares for patients
with LMBSS at QEHB says: "Due to the complex nature of many rare diseases
patients need to attend multiple clinics for the different aspects of the
condition.
"It has been reported that this often leads to a general lack of awareness, and
lack of experience, amongst healthcare professionals when caring for patient
with rare diseases.
"This, in turn can lead to inequitable access to co-ordinated quality care,
resulting in patients feeling isolated and frustrated with the healthcare
system.
"The national LMBBS clinic at QEHB has been designed to provide a 'one-stop'
clinic ensuring patients with diagnosed or suspected LMBBS receive expert
attention and co-ordinated management.
The Rare Disease Centre will be able to
offer this clinic model to a wide range of rare diseases."
Help raise £1m for Europe's first Rare Disease Centre THE Sundaymercury and
Birmingham Mail have joined forces with the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham
Charity to raise £1 million to help set up Europe's first Rare Disease Centre at
the QE.
Drawing on the knowledge, skills and care of the QE, Birmingham Children's
Hospital and the University of Birmingham, the new unit will enable patients
from all over the UK to access treatment in one place.
Researchers will work, in turn, to develop cures for rare, genetic conditions
which collectively affect 3.5 million people in the UK.
For more details visit
www.birminghammail.co.uk and www.qehb.org/rare/ www.birminghammail.co.uk and
www.qehb.org/rare/The charity will also benefit from the star-studded Pride of
Birmingham awards at the city's historic Town Hall on September 26, during which
courage, caring and community will be recognised.
FACTFILE LMBBS is a ¦rare, autosomal recessive genetic syndrome affecting one in
100,000 babies born.
It is characterised by night blindness or poor vision (most
people with LMBBS will be registered blind by the age of 16); Polydactyl (extra
fingers and toes at birth); obesity; mild to moderate learning difficulties;
developmental delay/ behavioural problems; kidney disease and Hypogonadism
(diminished functional activity of the gonads).
That is the pledge from MP Greg Mulholland as he prepares to carry on into 2016
a campaign for NHS funding of drugs for ultra-rare diseases.
The initiative led by the Otley-based politician - #FundOurDrugsNOW - celebrated
a major success last month with the news Vimizim, which treats Morquio Syndrome,
would be available through the NHS.
Morquio Syndrome is a degenerative, inherited condition that severely inhibits
growth.
Mr Mulholland's fight to get the NHS to provide the only treatment currently
available for the disease lasted 13 months.
"In addition to Morquio Syndrome, I learnt that people suffering from Tuberous
Sclerosis Complex and a rare form of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy were also
waiting for the drugs they needed to be approved.
He went on to outline the pain experienced by all the affected 218 families each
time there has been a delayed or cancelled 'decision' regarding treatment
funding by the authorities.
He said: "What kept our campaign going was the sheer inspiration from those
suffering with these ultra-rare diseases.
Looking forward to 2016, he added: "The Vimizim announcement was fantastic news
for those suffering from Morquio Syndrome, and for that, full credit must go to
the families who fought so hard, the MPS Society and to Parliamentary colleagues
who joined our campaign.
For those with a little-known neurological condition called Foreign Accent
Syndrome, that question is not an idle consideration but a day-to-day reality.
Foreign Accent Syndrome is not the only strange condition to affect people.
According to Rare Disease UK, a support network for sufferers, there are an
estimated 3.5 million people with a unusual illnesses in Britain today, ranging
from a phobia of bridges to hallucinations of gigantism.
Foreign Accent Syndrome

This little-known condition alters the intonation of the sufferer's speech,
giving the impression that they are speaking with a foreign accent.
Arising from
damage in the left frontal lobe of the brain, the condition is often found in
stroke victims and is often a transitory in nature.
As Professor Nick Miller of Newcastle University points out, though, the
syndrome has less to do with foreign accents than the name implies.
Although Kay Russell has been subject to a degree of media flippancy, she has
fared better than the Norwegian woman who was the first recorded victim of the
syndrome.
Morgellons Syndrome

Morgellons syndrome is the most contentious and wince-inducing condition on our
list.
Although yet to be officially classified as a disease, those who claim
affliction - and there are several thousand in the US - report the presence of
subcutaneous parasites which manifest themselves as long, fibre-like worms that
move around the body.
With the suggestion being put forward
that the "fibrous parasites" can actually be explained much more simply: they
are actually fibres from patients' clothes which have become entrenched in open
wounds.
Taking its name from the Greek term for
"purple pigment", the disease causes a build-up of toxic porphyrins, which
discolour the urine of victims and, in some instances, trigger paranoid
delusions.
Todd's syndrome

The author Lewis Carroll was said to have been inspired to write Alice in
Wonderland after the onset of a bizarre neurological condition.
Although historical diagnosis
is risky, scholars agree that these "disordered fortifications" were the likely
product of Todd's syndrome, a condition which distorts perceptions of size, and
induces the shrinking feeling Alice experiences.
The condition is suprisingly common.
It's not recognised as a medical
condition, but commonly affects children.
This is a relatively common
condition and a potentially dangerous one, as it can induce panic in drivers,
which can be quite a hazard in bridge-dense places such as New York.
While we may be tempted to smile at the idea of someone plagued with worries
about clowns, or who crave inedible objects, as Stephen Nutt from Rare Disease
UK points out, the effects can be life-changing.
And with one in 17 people
developing a rare disease during their lifetime, you or I could be next.

Researchers to Present Data on Improving the Understanding of PNH and aHUS and
Underscoring the Effectiveness of Soliris® (eculizumab) Treatment at ASH 2014
Annual Meeting

LENGTH: 445  words


Washington, D.C.: Biotechnology Industry Organization has issued the following
news release:

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced that researchers
will present data from clinical studies of Soliris® (eculizumab) in patients
with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic
syndrome (aHUS), two life-threatening and ultra-rare diseases caused by chronic
uncontrolled complement activation, as well as data from the Global aHUS
Registry, at the 56th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology
(ASH).
Soliris is the first and only approved treatment for PNH and aHUS.
Soliris, a first-in-class terminal complement inhibitor, is approved in nearly
50 countries as a treatment for patients with PNH, a debilitating, ultra-rare
and life-threatening blood disorder characterized by complement-mediated
hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), and in nearly 40 countries as a
treatment for patients with aHUS, a genetic, chronic and ultra-rare disease
associated with vital organ failure and premature death.
Soliris and PNH

Washington, D.C.: Biotechnology Industry Organization has issued the following
news release:

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced that researchers
will present data from clinical studies of Soliris® (eculizumab) in patients
with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic
syndrome (aHUS), two life-threatening and ultra-rare diseases caused by chronic
uncontrolled complement activation, as well as data from the Global aHUS
Registry, at the 56th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology
(ASH).
Soliris is the first and only approved treatment for PNH and aHUS.
Soliris, a first-in-class terminal complement inhibitor, is approved in nearly
50 countries as a treatment for patients with PNH, a debilitating, ultra-rare
and life-threatening blood disorder characterized by complement-mediated
hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), and in nearly 40 countries as a
treatment for patients with aHUS, a genetic, chronic and ultra-rare disease
associated with vital organ failure and premature death.

Mercersburg boy to undergo transplant surgery for rare disease next week

Chevy Hockenberry is a friendly, playful 22-month-old boy just like other
children.
Unlike other boys his age though, Chevy has a rare disease and will
undergo transplant surgery next week.
After dealing with several illnesses since birth, Chevy was diagnosed with
Hurler syndrome in January, said Melissa Johnson, Chevy's mother who resides in
Mercersburg.
Hurler syndrome is a rare, inherited disease where a person's body cannot
produce a certain enzyme that helps break down and process long chains of sugar
molecules, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center's website.
"Bone marrow transplant has been used in several
patients with this condition.
The treatment has had mixed results."
Chevy has had weekly enzyme replacement therapy treatments since he was
diagnosed, as well as chemotherapy, with his second round of treatment beginning
Saturday, Johnson said.
Although the treatments make Chevy tired and are sometimes painful, they will
help him prepare for the stem cell transplant on March 15 at Milton S. Hershey
Medical Center, she said.
One thing that has helped Johnson throughout Chevy's medical treatments is one
of Chevy's doctors introducing them to another family whose son also had Hurler
syndrome and underwent the same treatment.

A mom to a four-and-a-half year old with two rare conditions, Jones is grateful
to her peers, other parents of children with special needs, whom she's come to
know through her ongoing involvement with the Rare Disease Foundation's family
and patient support programs.
More than about finishing the
gruelling course, Jones and her team have dedicated their participation to the
Rare Disease Foundation and are using it as a means of raising funds and
awareness.
"Meeting the parents at the Rare Disease Foundation, I couldn't have
gotten through a lot of it without their support.
Jones' son Max was diagnosed with Weaver syndrome, a rare overgrowth disorder,
as well as Polymicrogyria.
"That's a rare brain malformation that causes
developmental delays.
Joining her on her Mudderella team, dubbed Max's Bombshells, are friends, old
co-workers and a mother of another child with Weaver syndrome.

Newquay residents keen to help light up the lives of sufferers of a rare disease
have until November 24 to purchase tickets for a grand party.
The family of five-year-old Shania Knuckey, who was diagnosed with Gorlin
Syndrome in March last year, are covering their Sweetbriar Crescent home in
Christmas lights in a bid to raise cash and increase awareness of the condition.
"Last year we had a little collection box outside and raised £200 for the Gorlin
Syndrome group."
Gorlin Syndrome is a rare medical condition which has more than 100 symptoms,
including skin disorders and cysts.

MELBOURNE researchers have unlocked some of the mystery surrounding DiGeorge
syndrome, a rare disease that causes birth defects.
Walter and Eliza Hall Institute researcher Dr Anne Voss and her colleague Dr Tim
Thomas led a team of researchers to investigate why babies with DiGeorge
syndrome had the same DNA mutation on chromosome 22 but their defects varied
widely.
The researchers found that a protein, MOZ, was responsible for switching on or
off the activity of a major gene involved in the disease.

Understanding, family support remain crucial for Chinese children suffering from
rare diseases.

XINGXIN / CHINA DAILY

Understanding, family support remain crucial for Chinese children suffering from
rare diseases, reports Zhao Xu.
Four types of rare diseases

Rett syndrome, originally termed cerebroatrophic hyperammonemia, is a genetic
postnatal neurological disorder of the gray matter of the brain that almost
exclusively affects females but has also been found in male patients.
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI and sometimes known as brittle bone disease) is a
congenital bone disorder characterized by brittle bones that are prone to
fracture.
Li's daughter, An An, then merely 16 months old,
was diagnosed with Rett syndrome, a sporadic neurological disorder that strikes
one in every 15,000 people, predominantly female.
In its early stages, the syndrome's symptoms are similar to that of autism.
Although patients gradually open up, in most cases, they will be unable to use
their hands or feet, or develop any verbal skills, as a direct result of the
brain damage.
But we persisted, living
on day by day with all the mishaps and mayhem of the disease while hoping for
the best," said the 36-year-old mother.
"Quite often, such denials are aided by the fact that rare diseases, by
definition, are diseases that hit only a tiny segment of the population."
Rough figures

In the United States, the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 defines the term as any
disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the country, or
about one in 1,500 people.
"The 15 million figure often cited for China is a rough estimate at best, since
we have no official definition for 'rare diseases' and have conducted no
comprehensive census on the number of sufferers.
Wang Yi'ou is the founder of the Beijing-based NGO China-Dolls Center For Rare
Disorders.
After suffering repeated fractures since 1, Wang was diagnosed with
osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, at the age of 16.
Hitting one per 20,000 live births, the congenital disease gives its victims
defective connective tissue, rendering them petite "China dolls" with stunted
growth and fragile bones.
It was not meant for her son, who had brittle bone
disease, but for herself and her husband, the heartbroken mother told us."
"She said, 'It kills my son to be reminded that he's a rare-disease patient.
"Telling from my own experience, the boy's denial of his own condition, and by
extension himself, has stemmed in large part from the evasiveness adopted by his
entire family against the disease.
WANG JING / CHINA DAILY

Wang's organization is one of the major Chinese beneficiaries of donations from
the popular Ice Bucket Challenge campaign helping sufferers of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis disease.
Zheng Yu, whose 15-year-old daughter, Gu Ruofan, first showed signs of a rare
disease called mucopolysaccharidosis in kindergarten, believes that an adult
very often fails to gauge the grit of a minor.
"My girl was diagnosed at 4, but we kept it from her for another four years,
until 2007, when I took her to a symposium in Taiwan focused on the disease.
An An was diagnosed with Rett syndrome when
she was 16 months old.

A GENETIC DISEASE EXPERT FROM THE 301 HOSPITAL

The idea that your rare-disease child needs to take no responsibility for his or
her health is a myth, and encourages nothing but self-pity.
It's up to parents
to instill in their kids a strong sense of regimen,  which they then need to
plan their lives around their disease."
If acknowledging the stark reality of a rare disease represents the first step
forward, then what comes next should be opening up to the world around, said
Meng Yan, a genetic disease expert from the 301 Hospital in Beijing.
"A rare-disease child, especially those with conspicuous physical changes, draws
confidence from his loved ones to face up to the inquisitive stares he or she is
certain to encounter out on the streets," she said.
A sense of regimen

A rare-disease child who has decided to "go out" is almost certain to suffer
occasional emotional pain, said Zheng, who insists that her daughter goes to
school.
"For anyone, with or without a disease, respect is something to be earned," she
said.
Yet no love should stand in the way of parents taking disciplinary action
against their "rare kids", conceded Zhao Ning, whose 8-year-old daughter was
diagnosed with phenylketonuria, a metabolic genetic disorder, upon birth.
Sufferers of the disease lack in their body a special type of enzyme necessary
for metabolizing amino acid.
"The idea that your rare-disease child needs to take no responsibility for his
or her health is a myth, and encourages nothing but self-pity," said Zhao, whose
daughter, apart from attending regular schools, has learned to play music and
even swim.
"It's up to parents to instill in their kids a strong sense of regimen, which
they then need to plan their lives around their disease."
"I understand all the concerns a 'rare parent' has in not having another child,
but my little one is working miracles on her elder sister.
"Worldwide, nearly 7,000 different types of rare diseases have been identified.
"If anything, the stark reality has made it more crucial for parents to remember
that your rare child has a life to explore, whatever its length.
They are
responsible for laying the very first brick for the bridge of understanding
between a rare kid and his disease, between him and the rest of the world."
Early this year, Li got an email from the mother of another child suffering from
Rett syndrome, from overseas.

THE heart-broken mother of a Black Country schoolboy who died after a ten-year
battle with a rare disease has paid tribute to her 'one-in-a-million' son.
Ben, a pupil at Meadows Sports College, in Oldbury, was diagnosed at the age of
three with Hunter Syndrome - a genetic disorder affecting around 2,000 people
across the globe.
Hunter Syndrome prevents the body from breaking down chemicals, causing a
build-up of toxins.
Former WBC Super Middleweight World Champion Richie Woodhall's dad, Lennie,
heard of Ben's condition and presented him with a Baggies shirt.

Rough figures

In the United States, the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 defines the term as any
disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the country, or
about one in 1,500 people.
"The 15 million figure often cited for China is a rough estimate at best, since
we have no official definition for 'rare diseases' and have conducted no
comprehensive census on the number of sufferers.
Wang Yi'ou is the founder of the Beijing-based NGO China-Dolls Center For Rare
Disorders.
After suffering repeated fractures since 1, Wang was diagnosed with
osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, at the age of 16.
Hitting one per 20,000 live births, the congenital disease gives its victims
defective connective tissue, rendering them petite "China dolls" with stunted
growth and fragile bones.
It was not meant for her son, who had brittle bone
disease, but for herself and her husband, the heartbroken mother told us."
"She said, 'It kills my son to be reminded that he's a rare-disease patient.
"Telling from my own experience, the boy's denial of his own condition, and by
extension himself, has stemmed in large part from the evasiveness adopted by his
entire family against the disease.

Wang's organization is one of the major Chinese beneficiaries of donations from
the popular Ice Bucket Challenge campaign helping sufferers of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis disease.
Zheng Yu, whose 15-year-old daughter, Gu Ruofan, first showed signs of a rare
disease called mucopolysaccharidosis in kindergarten, believes that an adult
very often fails to gauge the grit of a minor.
"My girl was diagnosed at 4, but we kept it from her for another four years,

A GENETIC DISEASE EXPERT FROM THE 301 HOSPITAL

The idea that your rare-disease child needs to take no responsibility for his or
her health is a myth, and encourages nothing but self-pity.
It's up to parents
to instill in their kids a strong sense of regimen,  which they then need to
plan their lives around their disease."
If acknowledging the stark reality of a rare disease represents the first step
forward, then what comes next should be opening up to the world around, said
Meng Yan, a genetic disease expert from the 301 Hospital in Beijing.
"A rare-disease child, especially those with conspicuous physical changes, draws
confidence from his loved ones to face up to the inquisitive stares he or she is
certain to encounter out on the streets," she said.
A sense of regimen

A rare-disease child who has decided to "go out" is almost certain to suffer
occasional emotional pain, said Zheng, who insists that her daughter goes to
school.
"For anyone, with or without a disease, respect is something to be earned," she
said.
Yet no love should stand in the way of parents taking disciplinary action
against their "rare kids", conceded Zhao Ning, whose 8-year-old daughter was
diagnosed with phenylketonuria, a metabolic genetic disorder, upon birth.
Sufferers of the disease lack in their body a special type of enzyme necessary
for metabolizing amino acid.
"The idea that your rare-disease child needs to take no responsibility for his
or her health is a myth, and encourages nothing but self-pity," said Zhao, whose
daughter, apart from attending regular schools, has learned to play music and
even swim.
"It's up to parents to instill in their kids a strong sense of regimen, which
they then need to plan their lives around their disease."
"I understand all the concerns a 'rare parent' has in not having another child,
but my little one is working miracles on her elder sister.
"Worldwide, nearly 7,000 different types of rare diseases have been identified.
"If anything, the stark reality has made it more crucial for parents to remember
that your rare child has a life to explore, whatever its length.
They are
responsible for laying the very first brick for the bridge of understanding
between a rare kid and his disease, between him and the rest of the world."
Early this year, Li got an email from the mother of another child suffering from
Rett syndrome, from overseas.

Abeona Therapeutics Announces Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results, Recent
Clinical Highlights

LENGTH: 769  words


Aug. 16 -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: ABEO) a clinical-stage
biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering gene and plasma-based therapies
for life-threatening rare diseases, today announced financial results for the
second quarter.
"The second fiscal quarter of 2016 brought significant advancements in our goal
of building a strong leadership position in the development of innovative
therapies for rare diseases," stated Steven H. Rouhandeh, Executive Chairman.
"We are excited about the initial biopotency signals seen in our Sanfilippo Type
A clinical trial, and are looking forward to advancing multiple important new
therapeutic candidates for the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), as
announced last week.
The milestones include the
dosing of the first patient in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial with ABO-102 for
patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type A, the FDA allowance of our Phase 1/2
clinical study in Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB), and, most recently, the
European regulatory approval for our MPS IIIA Phase 1/2 clinical study to be
conducted at Cruces University Hospital in Bilbao, Spain.
Recent Abeona Operating Highlights

* On May 17, 2016, Abeona announced that the first patient in its Phase 1/2
trial for ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), a single treatment gene therapy strategy for
patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA), has been enrolled at
Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.
* On May 24, 2016, Abeona announced the FDA Allowance of its Investigational New
Drug (IND) for a Phase 1/2 clinical study with ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU) for patients
with Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB).
* On August 2, 2016, Abeona provided an update on the initial subjects enrolled
in this trial, stating that ABO-102 had been well tolerated with no safety or
tolerability concerns identified through 30-days post-injection, and that
encouraging signs of early biopotency had been observed in urinary and CSF GAG
(heparan sulfate) measurements as well as potential disease-modifying effects in
the liver and spleen.
* On August 9, 2016, Abeona announced a collaboration with the EB Research
Partnership, EB Medical Research Foundation and Stanford University for the
development of treatments for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).
Clinical results for the lead EB program (EB-101) were recently presented at the
opening Plenary Session of the Society for Investigative Dermatology in May
2016, and Investigators at Stanford are recruiting patients for a Phase 2
clinical trial of EB-101 in adolescents age 13 and older to determine the effect
of type VII collagen gene corrective grafts on wound healing efficacy.

Keeping Track: Ilaris Adds Three Rare Disease Claims; Sirukumab Submitted;
Exondys 51's Surprising Approval

LENGTH: 1908  words


FDA's past week started with a surprise and concluded with breakthrough
approvals.
On Sept. 23, FDA's simultaneous approvals of three breakthrough-designated rare
disease indications for 's Ilaris extended the biologic's reach in periodic
fever syndromes.
announced the resubmission its Parkinson's disease therapy Xadago after a
complete response letter, and  prepared for the upcoming user fee goal for its
ophthalmic antihistamine candidate.

Following appeals, commissioner Califf deferred to Woodcock, and the antisense
oligonucleotide was cleared under the accelerated approval pathway for treatment
of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients who have a confirmed mutation
of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping.
(/)

The disagreements prolonged the review, making eteplirsen one of the rare new
molecular entity approvals that missed its user fee goal, which fell on May 26.
Three Breakthrough Indications In One Day For Novartis' Ilaris

Novartis' Ilaris (canakinumab) added three more rare and distinct types of
periodic fever syndromes to labeling with simultaneous FDA approvals on Sept.
23.
Earlier this year, FDA granted Ilaris breakthrough therapy designations for
the three conditions, tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated periodic
syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase
deficiency (MKD) and familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).
(/)

FDA initially approved Ilaris, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1
beta, in 2009 for another periodic fever syndrome condition,
cryoporin-associated pediatric syndromes (CAPS).
The periodic fever syndromes
are a group of rare autoinflammatory diseases also referred to as hereditary
periodic fevers (HPF).
The priority review approvals and the breakthrough designations are both based
on results of the Phase III CLUSTER study, which "showed rapid (at Day 15) and
sustained disease control with Ilaris compared to placebo through 16 weeks, in
patients with either TRAPS, HIDS/MKD or FMF," according to Novartis.
The BLA seeks approval of the anti-interleukin 6 MAb for treatment of adults
with moderately to severely active RA who have failed or are intolerant to one
or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
A standard review by FDA could put the alternative lupus
treatment regimen on the market in mid-2017.
Benlysta is currently available for intravenous administration, with a one-hour
infusion every four weeks, for treatment of active, autoantibody-positive
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
BLISS-SC compared subcutaneous Benlysta with placebo; all patients also received
standard of care treatment.
The BLA seeks approval for
treatment of adults with active, autoantibody-positive SLE who are receiving
standard therapy, while the extension MAA is for a slightly more restrictive
claim of add-on therapy in adults with active, autobody-positive SLE with a high
degree of disease activity (e.g.
Invokamet XR, a fixed-dose combination of the SGLT2
inhibitor canagliflozin and an extended-release form of the biguanide metformin,
is indicated for adults with type 2 diabetes when treatment with both agents is
appropriate.
Newron Xadago Speeds Back To FDA

Newron announced the re-submission of its Xadago (safinamide) NDA on Sept. 22,
less than two months after receiving a reprieve from an FDA complete response
letter's requirement for new clinical studies of potential abuse liability and
dependence/withdrawal effects with the Parkinson's disease treatment.
Nicox requested priority review of AC-170 for treatment of ocular itching
associated with allergic conjunctivitis based on "clinical pediatric data"
included in the NDA, which referenced data for J&J's Zyrtec under the 505(b)(2)
pathway.
Yuvvexy, previously known as TX-004HR, is a small, digitally inserted vaginal
estradiol softgel capsule for treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia, or

Aug. 21--The Wyatt's Walk and Run 5K will take place Oct. 24 at Cumberland
University and will look to raise awareness for Smith Magenis Syndrome (SMS),
which occurs when a person is missing a portion of chromosome 17.
"There has been little research done on this disorder, and there are really no
treatment options for SMS specifically, or a road map to follow other than
treating a wide variety of medical and behavioral issues individually as they
arise," she said.
Missy Longman and Jennifer Iannuzzi founded the SMS Research Foundation in 2007
after their daughters were diagnosed with the syndrome.
"When your child has a rare disease, the biggest thing you can do is research
and reach out to other families dealing with it," Rogers said.
Rogers said the syndrome affects one in 25,000 and Tennessee only has three or
four families dealing with a member with SMS, and one of those families lives in
Mt.
"With it being a rare disease and two people in Wilson County, it seems like
it's a right thing to do."

SAVING ASHLEY: He's only five and has a deadly disease he can't yet pronounce.
He has a rare, incurable and deadly disease.
Smart minds can't find a cure
for aHUS (Atypical Haemolytic-Uraemic Syndrome) but the treatment works well to
rein in his roguish immune system.
There are no guarantees Alexion will continue to fund
Ashley's treatment.
The pharmaceutical giant has lately turned down further pleas from Australian
patients who need it compassionately.
When the Yale University
researchers hit on a potential way to stop a rampant immune system, in the early
1990s, they turned attention to treating big diseases.
CONTINUED NEXT PAGE FROM PREVIOUS PAGE But the persistence of a British
haematologist, who wanted to try the drug on some of his patients with an
ultra-rare autoimmune disease, finally paid off.
The 11 patients on the trial were getting better.
The brakes went on the big diseases and the Alexion team switched its focus to
rare ones.
They started applying it to those with Ashley's syndrome.
In the next few years, after approval as a treatment for aHUS, calls came
through from doctors around the world.
Dr Kausman recalls: "He was at the more severe end of the disease.
As Ashley tries to recite the name of his disease - Atypical Haemolytic Uraemic
Syndrome - Diesel nips his ankles.
He falters through the words: "Acypital
Heemic Uric Syndrome."
For too long, his disease consumed the family - Mum, Dad and five children,
including sisters Tahlia and Mikayla, who share the room up the hall from the
boys.
That unpronounceable disease isn't talked about so much anymore.
People with rare diseases
believe it's helped nudge the program - and lifesaving drugs - out of their
reach.
Megan Fookes, who lives with a rare disease, thinks the word
made the process less objective.
She is the director of a
growing force in rare diseases advocacy - Rare Voices Australia.
Ashley received the usual treatment for aHUS patients.
They are usually expensive because they are
developed for niche markets of ultra-rare disease patients.
Megan Fookes says the Australian health system, despite more drug company
research into rare diseases, isn't supporting their successes once the results
come in.
To her it's a sign that the small, rare disease cohort is considered
second class at the highest levels.
About 20 people hooked into a teleconference -
department bureaucrats and representatives for rare disease patients, drug
companies and doctors.
Australia's celebrated rigour in its medical research seems to be
tripping up rare disease funding.
Orphan drugs often fail the test to be on the
program because patient groups are so small they often can't meet the strident
double-blind clinical trials of drugs for common diseases.
"For some reason, rare diseases patients have to plead for their lives.
They're born with the disease.
The disease
was deadly.
Since 2009 - when "substantially" was inserted - treatment for only one new
disease group has been added to the list of beneficiaries from the program.
Another drug was also added, but it was an update to a disease already covered
before 2009.
A rare diseases representative, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
Herald Sun that a meeting with Dr Hill was particularly frustrating.
The idea of the program was to allow access to these targeted rare disease
treatments that can't pass the Pharmaceutical Benefit System's cost-benefit
test.
"As more drugs for rare diseases become available, it is harder and harder to
get them listed," she says.
The disease is in Bianca's family.
Some relatives from decades before died young
from kidney disease, now known to be caused by aHUS.
The RCH staff have seen Ashley bottom out with his disease, founder on invasive
treatments, then bounce back with his $9000-a-dose drug.
He doesn't know much about his disease.

NHS drug battle as Leeds boy bids for funds

LENGTH: 424  words


Delays that  left a six-year-old Leeds boy with only "goodwill" to pay for his
treatment has had his case put before ministers.
Sam Brown is one of just 88 people in the UK with the rare Morquio syndrome, in
which child growth slows and mobility is drastically reduced.
While there is no
cure to the life limiting condition, trials have shown the Vimizim drug can slow
down the disease.
Leeds MP Greg Mulholland, has told health ministers the families of this and
other ultra-rare diseases cannot wait for another NHS drugs funding strategy.
Any
delay in guaranteeing drug access could cause deterioration of their conditions,
and this would be irreversible."
Sam's mother Katy said the NHS was failing to set out just how it will target
ultra-rare diseases.
Health minister George Freeman the NHS had to "operate with finite resources"
and that any funding for one condition would come at the cost to another.

RARE DISEASE LIMITS GROWTH

Morquio syndrome effects just a handful of children, but its effects can be
devastating for the families concerned.
The inherited disease starts to be seen as the child grows up, with radically
reduced growth and eventually severely reduced mobility.
The life limiting condition is caused by a failure of the body to breakdown
certain sugars, which then build up in the body and damage organs.
There is no cure for the condition.

Tampons   not cause   of illness,   MD says

BYLINE: CHARLOTTE MONTGOMERY; GAM

LENGTH: 552 words


By  CHARLOTTE MONTGOMERY
   While scientists continue to chase the elusive cause of toxic shock
 syndrome, an Ottawa obstetrician and gynecologist is convinced the rare
 disease is being mistakenly linked to the use of tampons.
Dr. Watt, who is holidaying in the United States and was not available
 for an interview, said in his letter that he believes blood infected with
 the disease is pushed into the uterus during intercourse and can enter the
 circulatory system because of changes in the lining of the uterus during
 menstruation.
Because most young women prefer tampons, the disease is thus linked to
 their use, he said.
The failure to explore this possibility in the published reports on the
 disease which he has read, Dr. Watt says, "shows a lack of either
 imagination or appreciation of the present 'sexual liberty.'
Dr. Alastair Clayton, director general of Health and Welfare Canada's
 laboratory centre for disease control in Ottawa, said he could find no
 fault with Dr. Watt's theory.
The current theory is that the bacteria which causes toxic shock
 syndrome is present in the vagina and that the tampon allows it to build
 up in a "plug effect," or that the bacteria finds the tampon a good place
 to grow.
Although his laboratory has developed a questionnaire for victims of
 toxic shock syndrome, it does not ask directly about sexual practices, he
 said.
Canada has had 43 reported cases of toxic shock syndrome, including
 three deaths, he said.
Controversy last year about the rare disease, which can cause a drop in
 blood pressure, shock and can result in heart and renal failure, led to
 new federal regulations which require manufacturers to satisfy health
 officials of the safety of their product before they are given permission
 to begin sales.
Package labels must also include warnings that there is a believed
 association of the syndrome and the use of tampons.
Betty Hooper, a spokesman for the U. S. Centre for Disease Control in
 Atlanta, which has had 1,211 reported cases of toxic shock syndrome,
 including 87 deaths, said researchers there considered sexual habits early
 in their work.
They found nothing of statistical significance to link the
 disease with sexual habits, Mrs. Hooper said.
Research into the cause of the disease itself is continuing in Canada,
 the United States and England, Dr. Clayton said.

A cause of her death, however, wasn't the bite but her
disease known as vascular ehlers danlos syndrome.
/ Courtesy of JTBC A woman
suffering from a rare vascular disease died after being bitten on her back by a
neighbor, sources reported on Monday.
The autopsy revealed that the victim suffered from a rare disease known as
'vascular ehlers danlos syndrome.'
Patients with the disease suffer rupture of

Her lawyer said during her interrogation before
incarceration on Thursday, 'The victim's death wasn't directly caused by the

HEALTH;
Canadians find causes for 146 rare diseases;
Researchers and clinicians are praising the groundbreaking effort, saying it
will enable rapid diagnoses

BYLINE: IVAN SEMENIUK

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.
No one had seen anything like it at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario,
so researchers there documented the baby's symptoms and dubbed the condition
"microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome."
Now, by comparing the baby's DNA with that obtained from a handful of similar
cases worldwide, Kym Boycott, a clinical geneticist at the Ottawa research
hospital, and her colleagues have pinpointed the single gene mutation
responsible - and they have done the same for 145 other rare childhood diseases.
"I think the biggest impact that will come from this is in our ability to change
the way we care for patients," Dr.
The avalanche of new discoveries, reported Thursday in the American Journal of
Human Genetics, is the fruit of a co-ordinated nationwide study called FORGE
(Finding of Rare Disease Genes in Canada).
Researchers and clinicians are praising the groundbreaking effort, saying it
will enable rapid diagnoses, guide treatment and in some cases point the way to
future therapies for children living with the burden of little-known but often
severely disabling genetic deficits.
"Even if we don't have a treatment, having a diagnosis is invaluable to patients
and their families," said Ada Hamosh, clinical director of the McKusick-Nathans
Institute of Genetic Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who was
not involved in the study.
Researchers estimate there could be as many as 7,000 rare diseases.
Such
diseases have received little attention until now because they typically occur
in fewer than one in 2,000 people.
Many of the disorders remain undocumented, which means those who are afflicted
by them have had little hope of knowing the cause of their disorder, let alone
of finding an effective treatment.
Starting in 2011, the FORGE collaboration was among the first to leverage new
high-speed DNA-sequencing technologies to tackle the rare disease conundrum.
"FORGE Canada and Kym Boycott were ahead of the world and have continued to lead
the world in data sharing and bringing tools to understand the causes of rare
disorders," Dr. Hamosh said.
Boycott and her colleagues solicited clinicians
across the country to submit information about rare cases they had encountered.
Out of 371 submissions, they identified 264 children or young adults who from
birth exhibited the hallmarks of a rare genetic disorder.
To identify a cause for each disorder, the FORGE team paired their Canadian
cases with at least one unrelated case of the same syndrome elsewhere in the
world or, in some cases, with an unaffected sibling.
While this
approach is not workable for complex diseases like cancer, which involve many
genes, it is remarkably effective for disorders that result from a single
mutation in the exome.
Of the the 146 genes that were identified by FORGE, 67 had never been linked to
a disease before.
"The impact of a single disease-gene
relationship is wide open for research and immediately clinically applicable."
Boycott, who is among those now involved in an international version of
FORGE, said that the ability of the Canadian clinical community to work together
on identifying rare diseases has attracted the attention of other countries
where researchers are less collaborative.
Phil Hieter, a professor of medical genetics at the University of British
Columbia, said that the discovery of rare disease genes by FORGE will allow
researchers who study the counterparts of those genes in model organisms such as
yeast or fruit flies to follow up and try to find out how a loss of function
triggers disease.

Agilis Biotherapeutics Announces Orphan Designation Approval in Europe for
Treatment of Angelman Syndrome

LENGTH: 560  words


May 4 -- Agilis Biotherapeutics, (Agilis), a biotechnology company advancing
innovative DNA therapeutics for rare genetic diseases that affect the central
nervous system (CNS), announced today that the European Commission (EC) has
granted Orphan Medicinal Product (OMP) designation in the European Union (EU) to
the Company's gene therapy product candidate, AGIL-AS.
AGIL-AS is being developed for the
treatment of Angelman syndrome (AS), a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by
severe intellectual and developmental disability.
AGIL-AS is the first
therapeutic to receive orphan designation for Angelman syndrome in Europe.
"Receiving orphan status from the EC, in conjunction with the previous orphan
drug designation from the US FDA, is another step on our path to bringing this
important new medicine to patients in need of an effective, durable treatment,"
said Mark Pykett, President and CEO of Agilis.
"The orphan designation in Europe
provides important benefits during development and commercialization, and
represents important progress as we seek to bring this novel treatment for AS to
the market."
Patricia Williams, Head of Regulatory Affairs at Agilis, said, "Receiving orphan
designation for Angelman syndrome in Europe, represents an important regulatory
milestone aimed at facilitating development of novel treatments for this
difficult to treat disease."
AGIL-AS is an innovative gene therapy candidate being investigated to treat AS
by using an AAV vector to deliver a corrective UBE3A gene to rescue neurological
deficits in patients suffering from this disease.
AS is a rare genetic disorder
caused by the deletion or mutation of the UBE3A gene.
According to The Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics (FAST),
the disorder strikes an estimated one in 15,000 live births.
"Agilis' receiving designation as an Orphan Medicinal Product is another
exciting milestone achieved for the Angelman syndrome community," said Paula
Evans, Director of FAST.
EC Orphan Designation is granted to drugs that are intended for the treatment of
life threatening or chronically debilitating rare diseases where no therapeutic
options either exist or are satisfactory.
Rare diseases are those defined as
having a prevalence of less than five in 10,000 in Europe.

Agilis Biotherapeutics Announces FDA Orphan Drug Designation for AGIL-AS for
Treatment of Angelman Syndrome

LENGTH: 549  words


Nov. 4 -- Agilis Biotherapeutics, LLC (Agilis), a biotechnology company
advancing innovative DNA therapeutics for rare genetic diseases that affect the
central nervous system (CNS), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to AGIL-AS, the
Company's gene therapy product candidate being developed for the treatment of
Angelman syndrome (AS), a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by severe
intellectual and developmental disability.
AGIL-AS is being investigated as a
new therapeutic to treat AS by delivering a corrective UBE3A gene to rescue
neurological deficits in patients suffering from this rare disease.
This is the
first drug to be granted an Orphan Drug Designation status by the U.S. FDA for
the indication of Angelman syndrome.
AS is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deletion/mutation of the UBE3A gene.
Characteristic features of the
condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech
impairment, seizures and ataxia.
According to The Foundation for Angelman
Syndrome Therapeutics (FAST), the disorder strikes an estimated 1 in 15,000 live
births.
"Receiving orphan drug designation from the FDA for AGIL-AS is another step on
our path to bringing this important new medicine to patients in dire need of an
effective, durable treatment.
Moreover, it signifies a landmark event, as it
marks the first Angelman syndrome drug to achieve this regulatory milestone,"
stated Mark Pykett, President and CEO of Agilis.
"We're extremely pleased that
we continue to make important clinical and regulatory progress, positioning us
to advance this new treatment to address such a devastating disease."
In May, the Company entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with
the University of South Florida (USF) for the treatment of AS using gene therapy
technology developed by Edwin Weeber, PhD, Professor, Molecular Pharmacology and
Physiology, Director of the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, and Chief
Scientific Officer at the USF Health Byrd Alzheimer's Research Institute, and
one of the world's foremost AS investigators.
"Agilis' Orphan Drug Designation for AGIL-AS is an important step forward for
the technology and for the Angelman syndrome community," Dr. Weeber stated.
"Restoration of UBE3A function using gene therapy has the potential to address
many of the neurological symptoms of AS and to positively impact the quality of
life of AS patients."

Caring out of the ordinary

LENGTH: 721 words


Understanding, family support remain crucial for Chinese children suffering from
rare diseases, reports Zhao Xu.
Li's daughter, An An, then merely 16 months old,
was diagnosed with Rett syndrome, a sporadic neurological disorder that strikes
one in every 15,000 people, predominantly female.
In its early stages, the syndrome's symptoms are similar to that of autism.
Although patients gradually open up, in most cases, they will be unable to use
their hands or feet, or develop any verbal skills, as a direct result of the
brain damage.
But we persisted, living
on day by day with all the mishaps and mayhem of the disease while hoping for
the best," said the 36-year-old mother.
"Quite often, such denials are aided by the fact that rare diseases, by
definition, are diseases that hit only a tiny segment of the population."
Rough figures

In the United States, the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 defines the term as any
disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the country, or
about one in 1,500 people.
"The 15 million figure often cited for China is a rough estimate at best, since
we have no official definition for 'rare diseases' and have conducted no
comprehensive census on the number of sufferers.
Wang Yi'ou is the founder of the Beijing-based NGO China-Dolls Center For Rare
Disorders.
After suffering repeated fractures since 1, Wang was diagnosed with
osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, at the age of 16.
Hitting one per 20,000 live births, the congenital disease gives its victims
defective connective tissue, rendering them petite "China dolls" with stunted
growth and fragile bones.
It was not meant for her son, who had brittle bone
disease, but for herself and her husband, the heartbroken mother told us."
"She said, 'It kills my son to be reminded that he's a rare-disease patient.
"Telling from my own experience, the boy's denial of his own condition, and by
extension himself, has stemmed in large part from the evasiveness adopted by his
entire family against the disease.
Mr Went, 74, of Glenelg, was diagnosed with a rare disease, Goodpasture syndrome
, which causes kidney failure and requires dialysis.
But, having miraculously regained most of his kidney function, he donated blood
to medical researchers interstate who were trying to solve how genetic risk
factors can cause or protect people from auto-immune diseases.
Mr Went was rushed to the renal unit at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and within
24 hours was diagnosed with Goodpasture syndrome and told he would be on
dialysis for the rest of his life.
But, thanks to an early diagnosis and
immediate dialysis treatment, a medical miracle - that doctors are unable to

include type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative

The breakthrough research has answered why some autoimmune systems "go rogue and
attack parts of the body" despite immune systems evolving over time to fight
infections and disease.
This leads to an auto-immune disease," Prof Kitching
said.
"We have known that in auto-immune diseases there are T-cells that make us
susceptible to disease and T-cells that protect us from disease.
"In Goodpasture disease, when the molecule DR15 is present, it can select and
instruct T-cells to attack the body.
If alone in our body, these damaging cells
can attack the body's tissues, resulting in very ill patients.

Gaucher's needs early treatment

New Delhi: In a country where thousands die due to rare diseases before
celebrating their first birthday, Sashank Tyagi has survived for 26 years with
Gaucher's disease.
Gaucher's disease is a genetic disorder in which fat gets accumulated around
vital organs.
"If left untreated, most patients die within the first year of
their birth.
According to Dr Verma, Tyagi's case is an example which shows how children with
rare diseases can survive longer with the right treatment.
Hence, we want the
government to come up with a policy to help such patients," he said.
The
hospital is organising an awareness programme on Monday-International Rare
Diseases Day.
Thalassemia, Down syndrome, MPS and Wilson's disease are some other genetic
disorders that affect about 7 crore people in India.
A study conducted by Indian
Council of Medical Research showed that the incidence of inborn errors of
metabolism, that cause some of the rare diseases, is much higher in India than
in the West.
Many such people can be saved by timely treatment with special diet
and medicines, said Dr Ratna Puri, medical geneticist.
The Delhi government recently formed a committee to develop a policy for
tackling these diseases and providing treatment.
"Awareness, accessibility and
affordability are key needs of such patients," said Prasanna Shirol, founder
member, Organisation for Rare Disease India.

A NEW drug that could transform the lives of children with a rare genetic
condition might be judged too expensive for the NHS.
Hunter Syndrome was in the headlines last year when Andrew Wragg, 40, a former
SAS soldier, was driven to despair by the decline of his son Jacob, 10, and
smothered him with a pillow.
The fatal syndrome, suffered almost exclusively by boys, is caused by a
defective enzyme that is unable to break down complex sugars produced as waste
products in the body.
But it will cost at least £ 100,000 per child per year, and as much as £ 300,000
for older, heavier patients who need bigger doses.
A patients' group has been lobbying ministers to confirm that the drug will be
funded under a special scheme for children with rare diseases.
Christine Lavery,
chief executive of The Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases (SMD), said:
"Funding for treatments for rare diseases similar to Hunter Syndrome is due to
end at Christmas.
But there has been no promise
that the Department of Health will fund the new drug for Hunter Syndrome.
Although not a cure the drug, which replaces the missing enzyme, may allow
affected children to lead near-normal lives if the condition is picked up early.
Dr Ed Wraith, a consultant at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, said:
"With this disease, there is damage to the heart, liver, brain and other organs,
which invariably leads to death before the age of 20.
The treatment is a major
breakthrough and it would be a tragedy if the DoH didn't provide the money."
The same is likely to be the case north of the Border, where the Scottish
Medicines Consortium has refused a related drug for a girl with a similar
condition.
Bob Wragg, 64, grandfather of Jacob, said: "Thank God they have found a
treatment at last."
An adult sufferer of the syndrome, Colin Arrowsmith, 26, from Newcastle, has
been receiving Elaprase weekly as part of a trial since February 2004.
"The treatment won't reverse the damage done but we've been told that it should
prevent further damage."

Decision Resources: Through 2018, Five New Drugs will Launch for the Treatment
of Myelodysplastic Syndromes

LENGTH: 546  words


New Delhi, Feb. 6 -- Decision Resources, one of the world's leading research and
advisory firms for pharmaceutical and healthcare issues, finds that, through
2018, five new drugs will launch for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS), three of which are expected to offer much-needed second-line therapeutic
options in the hypomethylating agent (HMA)-refractory higher-risk MDS
population.
Currently, there is only one curative treatment for MDS --
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).
However, old age and poor
general performance status classifies approximately 75 percent of patients as
ineligible for this treatment.
According to Niche Markets and Rare Diseases: Myelodysplastic Syndromes,
azacitidine is the leading therapeutic option for the disease in both the U.S.
and Europe.
Onconova also has an oral
formulation of rigosertib in development for lower-risk patients.
Citing the dearth of second-line options for higher-risk MDS patients, experts
are hopeful that several Phase II and III drugs will provide valuable
alternative therapeutic options, although they do not expect any drug during the
next decade to completely shift or uproot the MDS therapeutic landscape.
Improving overall survival, without sacrificing quality of life, is the key
therapeutic goal in higher risk MDS patients, while functional quality of life
via hematologic improvement is the primary goal in lower-risk patients."

EACH of the children on these pages is desperately ill. All are fighting some of
the rarest and most complex deadly diseases.
Some of the patients who arrive in its wards had been sent home to die, their
rare illnesses deemed to be untreatable.
We're helping this amazing hospital kick-start its Star Appeal which aims to
raise £3.5million to develop a world-class Rare Diseases Centre that will give
hope to thousands of suffering youngsters.
Today families who flock to the
Midlands from as far afield as Northern Ireland to access the hospital's
life-saving treatment are asking YOU for your help.
Currently Birmingham Children's Hospital treats more than one in 20 of all
children from across the UK who suffer rare diseases.
Specialists show that 75 per cent of all rare diseases affect children, with 30
per cent of all patients dying before the age of five.
The Government funds
treatment on the NHS - but it is up to fundraising initiatives to bankroll new
buildings.
Chief medical officer Fiona Reynolds, who has worked at Birmingham for more than
15 years as a paediatric intensive care doctor, said: "We look after six per
cent of all the children who suffer rare diseases b who come from around the UK,
including Cambridge, Norfolk, Northern Ireland, all for the experts we have
here.
""The definition of rare diseases is that they affect about one in 10,000
people.
The unit specialises in the most complex heart conditions, chronic liver and
kidney diseases, cancer, serious burns, epilepsy neurology and cystic fibrosis.
But when patients with
rare diseases visit the centre, they are often made to make multiple visits to
different areas of the hospital.
It's hoped the new centre will provide a "one-stop shop" for patients and their
families, including services such as diagnosis, assessments, treatment,
information, research and peer-to-peer support.
Mum-of-two Sarah-Jane Marsh, chief executive of the Birmingham Children's
Hospital, said: "We are seeing more and more children with very rare and complex
conditions who need a lot of support."

Elsie Wesley, five, from Tamworth, Staffs: Branchiootorenal Syndrome

Elsie was diagnosed with chronic renal failure at just two days old before
medics discovered she was suffering from this rare genetic condition which
affects the development of her ears, nose, throat and kidneys.
Marcus Tilley-Young, two, of Wolverhampton: Down's Syndrome with Chronic Kidney
Disease

Marcus was born with a combination of illnesses that has meant he has needed

By raising £3.65million, Birmingham Children's Hospital Charity will be able to
build a new centre to improve the lives of thousands of families from across the
UK who have children battling a rare or undiagnosed medical condition.
The first of its kind in the UK, the Rare Diseases Centre will provide patients
with one-stop access to a team of health experts, all from different
specialties, who will collaborate to assess and diagnose children.
The unit will
include the UK's first holistic dedicated Paediatric Rare Disease Centre.
The
aim is to build on the excellent care Birmingham provides to rare diseases
patients, using its expert clinical knowledge and skilled research teams to
become a national rare diseases centre.
A worrying number of rare disease sufferers receive incorrect diagnoses before
the final diagnosis at Birmingham Children's Hospital is made.
About 46 per cent
of the UK's rare diseases patients wait over 12 months to get the right
diagnosis.
What is a rare disease?
It's a life-threatening or chronically
debilitating disease that affects five people or fewer in 10,000 and requires
special, combined efforts to enable patients to be treated effectively.
Many rare diseases are genetic.
Well-known conditions
include Cystic Fibrosis and Huntington's disease, but there are many lesser
known such as Epidermolysis Bullosa and Lysosomal Storage Disorders that
children can inherit from their parents.

HIGHLIGHT: Parents of little girl with 'floppy baby syndrome' share their tale
ahead of Rare Disease Day


SINGAPORE - For their 15-month-old daughter, who might not live to see her next
birthday, Mr Xie Dingshan and Mrs Xie Jiyi are determined to make every moment
count and help their little one in her battle to survive.
But the rare and
incurable disease has not affected her mental and emotional development, and she
lights up whenever she sees her healthy older sister, aged 3.
Sharing their story to raise awareness ahead of Rare Disease Day, which takes
place on the last day of February every year, Mr Xie said: "What our daughter
has is so rare that the odds of winning the lottery are probably even higher."
Not all doctors know about Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy, and Xin Lin's
condition was missed during a development check-up when she was three months
old, said Mr Xie.
The doctor had thought she was "just slow".When she was eventually diagnosed,
the family was hit hard by the fact that her condition was incurable.
The disease causes muscles to weaken progressively and claims the majority of
lives by the age of two due to breathing problems, although some individuals
live longer, said Dr Tan Ee Shien, senior consultant at Genetics Service at KK
Women's and Children's Hospital's (KKH) Department of Paediatrics.
Children with the condition, dubbed the "floppy baby syndrome", experience
weakness and limpness in the neck and limbs.
Following Xin Lin's diagnosis, her parents underwent a genetic test and found
that they were both carriers of the spinal muscular atrophy gene, which meant a
one in four chance of their child having the condition.
MAJORITY LINKED TO GENETIC CAUSES

A rare disease may affect one in 2,000 people or fewer.
About 80 per cent of
rare diseases are linked to genetic causes, said Dr Wendy Liew, consultant at
Neurology Service at KKH's Department of Paediatrics.
In such cases, it is often
a mutation in a critical gene that leads to the disease, said Dr Tan.
"While
there is a family history of the condition in some cases, most are the first
occurrence in the family," she said.
Rare diseases can cause significant disability as they can affect many different
organ systems at once, she added.
There are about 6,000 to 8,000 known rare diseases
worldwide, but their prevalence in Singapore is not known as there is currently
no registry here that keeps track of patients.
According to Mr Kenneth Mah, vice-president of the Rare Disorders Society
(Singapore), about half of these uncommon diseases do not have a
disease-specific foundation supporting or researching them.
About 30 per cent of
children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthday unless
early intervention is given, said Mr Mah, whose non-profit provides financial
and emotional support to 75 families affected by rare diseases.
"Someone asked me if I feel stressed (by her condition) but the truth is,
whenever I see my little one smile, that de-stresses me.
Dr Tan Ee Shien from Genetics Service at KKH's Department of Paediatrics will
share about rare genetic diseases, their symptoms and management options.
Brooklyn toddler Jonah Weishaar has been diagnosed with an exceedingly rare
genetic disorder that prevents the body from processing certain sugars.
It's called Sanfilippo Syndrome, has no known treatment and usually kills before
age 20.
"This disease has not been fully documented.
Those with Sanfilippo Syndrome usually die by their early 20s.
The disease affects only one in a million children.
The disorder is part of a family of similar ailments called MPS diseases, for
which some treatments have been developed.
"They have done very well with many other diseases," said Dr. Maryam Banikazemi,
an expert on pediatric genetics at New York-Presbyterian Hospital who has worked
on Jonah's case.
If 10 people with the syndrome are found, study data can be turned over to a
pharmaceutical company for the development of a drug.
In the past, drug companies tended to avoid rare disorders, but federal
incentives for so-called "orphan drugs" means they're more willing to tackle
little-known diseases.

GRAPHIC: Mom Jill Wood holds son, Jonah, 2, who has rare disease, Sanfilippo
Syndrome, which could be fatal by the time he turns 20.
The report in the Oct. 1 New England Journal of Medicine confirms that serious
complications are common after major surgery -- about one in six patients -- but
the study shows what drives hospital mortality is failure to rescue.
Low-mortality hospitals have medical teams with the ability to rescue patients
by recognizing and heading off potentially catastrophic complications such as
deep wound infections, pneumonia, kidney failure, blood clots and strokes.
In spite of similar patterns of complications, patients at high-mortality
hospitals are nearly twice as likely to die after developing a serious
post-surgical complication, according to the study.
UM researchers to lead study of nephrotic syndrome

University of Michigan Health System researchers will lead a $10.25 million,
five-year effort called the Nephrotic Rare Disease Consortium to study nephrotic

A woman from Bovingdon who has been living with severe kidney pain for the past
14 years wants to raise awareness of the life-altering condition in time for
Rare Disease Day on Saturday, February 28.
Alison Banister, 54, who lives in Dinmore, was diagnosed with loin pain
haematuria syndrome, a combination of loin pain and haematuria, which is a
medical term for blood in the urine, after having her first attack of agonising
pain in her left loin in 2001.
This was surgically fixed in place, and although this
helped somewhat, I was left with loin pain haematuria syndrome - also known as
LPHS.
"The condition is said to be rare, with only 400 cases cited worldwide.
Numbers
are low because the condition is relatively unknown amongst the medical
profession.
This condition
affects every aspect of life.
Rare Disease Day takes place on the last day of February each year, and is a
worldwide campaign.
Its main objective is to raise awareness amongst the general
public and decision-makers about rare diseases and their impact on patients'
lives.

Two families unite with North Wales paediatricians to raise awareness on Rare
Disease Day

LENGTH: 880 words

DATELINE: New York



 London: Board of Community Health Council, UK Government has issued the
following news release:



 Two families with children who suffer from extremely rare disorders have joined
forces with paediatricians from Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board to raise
awareness on Rare Disease Day.
Rare Disease Day 4A rare disease is any disorder that affects a small
percentage of the population.
Although the disease may be rare, patients and
families share a common struggle.
Mari Elin Lewis, from Llandwrog, near Caernarfon, suffers from a very rare
condition called Aniridia, which affects her eyesight, and is caused by an even
rarer condition called WAGR syndrome.
Fewer than 300 people worldwide suffer from this condition and it is believed
Mari is the only one in Wales.
It is very much an emotional rollercoaster having a
child with such a rare condition.
"We've had to learn about her condition as we've gone on and to research as
much as possible in order to help Mari and get the assistance she needs.
Three-year-old Harry Thorogood, from Kinmel Bay, suffers with a rare and
severely disabling type of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome which means he
suffers between ten to fifteen seizures a day.
Rare Disease Day 6His symptoms began to show when he was six months old after
he suffered a severe seizure, lasting almost an hour.
His mother, Emma, said her son's condition, which only affects 1 in 19,000
people, was diagnosed by the paediatrics team at Glan Clwyd Hospital after
numerous tests over a ten month period.
"We also have the worry of not knowing what damage these seizures are causing
him, we are still learning about the disease but we know he will suffer
significant development delays.
"The condition also brings a high chance Harry could suffer from Sudden
Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) which is a constant worry for us.
She said: "In Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board (BCUHB) we have community and acute
based paediatricians who undertake the medical care of children who have rare
and complex disorders.
"This care continues throughout childhood and into the transition to adult
services or until their death for children with rare severely life limiting
conditions.
Rare Disease Day 1Dr Shakir Saeed, Consultant Paediatrician at Ysbyty Gwynedd,
says more research into rare conditions is required to help families and
professionals.
He said: "Rare diseases are associated with multiple other problems such as a
feeding issues, growth failure and usually multiple systems in the body are
affected.
We routinely signpost parents and families to specific rare
condition support group's websites.
"I fully believe more research in to rare conditions is required to help the
families and professionals."
Rare Disease Day is held on the last day of February every year to raise
awareness of rare diseases.

Cortendo: Cortendo Adds Two Late-Stage Assets to Its Rare Endocrine Disease
Franchise, Announces Related $33.2 Million Financing

LENGTH: 706  words


May 15 -- Cortendo AB (publ) [ticker: CORT on NOTC-A], a biopharmaceutical
company focused on rare endocrine disorders and other rare diseases, today
announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Aspireo
Pharmaceuticals' Somatoprim (DG3173), an investigational compound being studied
for the treatment of acromegaly.
Acquisition of Aspireo Pharmaceuticals' DG3173 for Acromegaly and Potential
Additional Applications

Cortendo has entered into an agreement to acquire Aspireo Pharmaceuticals'
DG3173, a next-generation, somatostatin analog (SSA) with a unique receptor
affinity profile, being investigated for the treatment of acromegaly, with
potential additional applications in Cushing's Syndrome and neuroendocrine
tumors.
"The addition of two novel, late-stage investigational compounds for the
treatment of rare endocrine disorders, DG3173 and ATL1103, coupled with our
existing Phase 3 asset for endogenous Cushing's Syndrome, COR-003, establishes
the cornerstone of Cortendo's rare endocrine disease franchise and demonstrates
our commitment to becoming a leader in providing innovative therapeutic options
to patients with rare diseases," said Matthew Pauls, president and chief
executive officer of Cortendo.
"There are significant unmet needs in the
diagnosis and treatment of both endogenous Cushing's Syndrome and acromegaly,
and we are passionate about the opportunity to simultaneously advance
development of COR-003, DG3173 and ATL1103 and commence pre-commercialization
activities, and to ultimately provide these patients and the physicians who
treat them with novel therapeutic options," Pauls added.
The financing is subject to shareholder approval of the AGM, which is scheduled
to be held on or about June 24, 2015, and is subject to certain other
conditions, including expected gross proceeds of at least $20 million and the
non-occurrence of any material adverse effects (as defined in the agreement with
the investors) prior to completion.
"We appreciate the support of all of our investors and their confidence in
Cortendo's ability to develop and commercialize novel therapeutics for the
treatment of rare endocrine disorders and other rare diseases," said Matthew
Pauls, president and chief executive officer of Cortendo.
Liam, 8, has Dravet syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy that causes
dozens of seizures per day.
"CHEO is an amazing hospital, and when you have a child with a life-threatening
condition, the hospital and staff really becomes a huge part of your family
life.
I also believe that gives local
researchers an amazing opportunity to get noticed on the world stage in respect
to Dravet syndrome research."
Dr. David Dyment, a clinician and investigator at CHEO who studies rare
diseases, is leading the CHEO research team, which is working on mice with
Dravet syndrome to find best treatments that may work in humans.
"But finding treatments to deal with
seizures will give people with Dravet syndrome a better quality of life."
In Ottawa there are less than 20 youths diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, he said.
"Dravet syndrome is a rare disease (and) we do not get any funding whatsoever
from any level of government," said Mandy.
"All monies raised through events
like the walk are all grassroots-driven by families and friends of children who
are afflicted by this terrible disease."
"We are so lucky to live in an amazing supportive community who supports our
efforts in a quest for a cure, better treatment options and most importantly to
raise awareness for catastrophic epilepsies like Dravet syndrome.

Strongbridge Biopharma Provides Corporate, Financial Update

LENGTH: 2293  words


Dec. 23 -- Strongbridge Biopharma plc, (Nasdaq:SBBP), a global commercial-stage
biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of
therapies for rare diseases with significant unmet needs, today announced a
corporate and financial update.
"Throughout the second half of 2016, Strongbridge has been focused on building
value in three key areas: enhancing the clinical development program and the
probability of regulatory success for COR-003, pursuing a commercial-stage rare
disease therapy resulting in the acquisition of the U.S. rights to KEVEYIS
(dichlorphenamide), and strengthening the financial condition of the Company,"
said Matthew Pauls, president and chief executive officer of Strongbridge.
"Executing on these initiatives strengthens our presence in rare diseases and
sets the stage for a number of value-creating events in 2017, including
commercial sales of KEVEYIS and completing enrollment in the SONICS study,"
Pauls added.
Expands Rare Disease Portfolio through Acquisition of U.S. Rights to KEVEYIS,
the First and Only FDA-Approved Treatment for Hyperkalemic, Hypokalemic, and
Related Variants of Primary Periodic Paralysis

Earlier today, Strongbridge announced in a separate press release that the
Company has acquired the U.S. rights to KEVEYIS, the first and only U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved product to treat hyperkalemic,
hypokalemic, and related variants of Primary Periodic Paralysis, which is a
group of rare hereditary disorders that causes potentially severe episodes of
muscle weakness and/or paralysis.
KEVEYIS is Strongbridge's first commercial
product, and expands the Company's rare disease franchises to include both
neuromuscular and endocrine diseases.
Provides Update on Timelines and Strengthens COR-003 Clinical Development
Program with Additional Phase 3 Study

The global Phase 3 SONICS clinical trial evaluating COR-003 (levoketoconazole)
for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is more than two-thirds
enrolled.
In addition, based upon Strongbridge's ongoing dialog with the FDA and
observation of the current regulatory landscape, the Company plans to initiate
LOGICS, a second global Phase 3 study of COR-003 for the treatment of endogenous
Cushing's syndrome.
The LOGICS study will supplement the long-term efficacy and
safety data from the ongoing SONICS study in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study that will enroll approximately 35 patients, of which
approximately two-thirds will have completed the SONICS study.
Strongbridge Selects Proprietary Technology for COR-005 Long-Acting Release
Formulation

COR-005 (veldoreotide) is a novel, investigational somatostatin analogue (SSA)
with proven and differentiated pharmacology in pre-clinical models and patients
with acromegaly.
COR-005 may provide the acromegaly community with a new
treatment option offering a unique clinical profile and delivery system.
General and administrative
expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included a $0.6 million
decrease in non-cash stock based compensation costs due to liability-classified
treatment of certain stock option awards in 2015.

These are the brave children being treated at a Birmingham hospital who are
suffering from some of the most rare diseases in the world.
And now the youngsters, who are all being treated at Birmingham Children's
Hospital, have been immortalised in a photo exhibition in the city centre in a
bid to raise money for a centre where they will all receive vital treatment.
Only twenty people in the world have this disease and Matilda is one of them

The 11-year-old suffers from Gaucher's Disease, which affects one in 100,000
people.
She was finally diagnosed with the condition last year, after an nine-year
battle by her mum Hadia Abdalla, who knew something wasn't quite right with her
youngest child.
She was referred to the hospital, which is raising funds for a rare diseases
centre, and underwent a bone marrow test.
Matab, who is only one of two patients being treated for Type I of the genetic
disease at the hospital out of 89,000 patients, joined other rare disease
sufferers to promote the Stars Of Steelhouse Lane exhibition being held in
Victoria Square.
Other children included Matilda Hatton, from Walsall, who is one of an estimated
20 people to have Sensenbrenner Syndrome, siblings Noah and Ruby Harvey, from
West Bromwich, who both have Glutaric Aciduria Type 1, and Skye Gardner, from
Wednesbury who has Williams Syndrome.
The appeal needs to raise £3.65 million and will lead to a Rare Diseases Centre
based at the hospital.
It will bring a team of experts from all the specialities at the hospital under
one roof and increase research into the many different conditions.

This is the first such case in Thailand and Southeast Asia, said Prof Teerawat
Kulthanan, dean of Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.
Through ultrasound, the team found that the babies were suffering from the
twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, caused by connecting blood vessels in their
shared placenta.
Division of Maternal Foetal Medicine Unit's chief, Dr Wittaya Thithaphan, said
twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome generally occurred in six out of every 10,000
pregnant women and treatment procedures usually depended on the severity of the
situation.
Yanee said she was very worried when doctors first said her twins were suffering
from a rare disease.
I had never heard about this disease before, and after an Internet search I
discovered that it was very rare and too expensive to treat," she said.
He added that
this would apply to other pregnant women suffering from this or other rare
syndromes.

Amy Foley, 28, from Midleton, Co Cork, has Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a genetic,
incurable connective tissue disease that affects the joints, muscles, bones,
blood vessels, and vital organs.
While her fiancé works full time, Amy, who graduated with a first class honours
diploma in Social Science, is finding it extremely difficult to attain permanent
part-time work because of the demands of managing her conditions, which also
include Postural Tachycardia Orthostatic Syndrome   an abnormal increase in
heart beat when changing position that can cause a significant drop in blood
pressure   and Mast Cell Activation Disorder, an immunological condition that
can lead to anaphylaxis, and has done so in Amy s case, requiring her to carry
an EpiPen.
Will I be trapped not only by my conditions but also by the welfare system?
Amy s plea comes as experts in rare diseases prepare to gather in Dublin Castle
next Monday morning, February 29, for a major conference to mark International
Rare Disease Day.
Attendees will be given an update on progress of the National Rare Disease Plan
for Ireland 2014-2018 and progress on the clinical programme for rare diseases.
An estimated 300,000-plus children and adults in Ireland are impacted by c6,000
rare diseases.

FDA Grants SOBI003 Orphan Drug Designation for the Treatment of MPS IIIA

LENGTH: 605  words


July 5 -- Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi) has been granted Orphan Drug
Designation (ODD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
company's development candidate SOBI003, a chemically modified human recombinant
sulfamidase for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA),
also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type A, a rare metabolic disorder.
MPS IIIA is a severe and debilitating disease, and this development program is
an important part of our mission of being pioneers in rare diseases.
Onset of Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA is in early childhood, and the disease
is characterised by severe and progressive developmental delay, motor
retardation and eventually dementia.
One in 100,000 children are born with the
inherited condition and very few patients survive into adulthood.
There is
presently no treatment for MPS IIIA.
About Orphan Drug Designation

The Orphan Drug Designation programme provides orphan status to drugs and
biologics which are defined as those intended for the safe and effective
treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases/disorders that affect fewer
than 200,000 people in the U.S., or that affect more than 200,000 persons but
are not expected to recover the costs of developing and marketing a treatment
drug.
[1]

About mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (Sanfilippo A syndrome)

MPS IIIA or Sanfilippo A syndrome is a progressive, life-threatening and rare
inherited metabolic disorder affecting children already from a young age.
MPS
IIIA belongs to a group of diseases called Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs).
The disease is usually identified at around four years of age and
the life-span of an affected child does not usually extend beyond the third
decade of life.
There is no treatment for MPS IIIA to date.

Understanding, family support remain crucial for Chinese children suffering from
rare diseases, reports Zhao Xu.

event organized by the Beijing-based China-Dolls Center for Rare Disorders.
An An was diagnosed with Rett syndrome when
she was 16 months old.
Li's daughter, An An, then merely 16 months old,
was diagnosed with Rett syndrome, a sporadic neurological disorder that strikes
one in every 15,000 people, predominantly female.
In its early stages, the syndrome's symptoms are similar to that of autism.
Although patients gradually open up, in most cases, they will be unable to use
their hands or feet, or develop any verbal skills, as a direct result of the
brain damage.
But we persisted, living
on day by day with all the mishaps and mayhem of the disease while hoping for
the best," said the 36-year-old mother.
"Quite often, such denials are aided by the fact that rare diseases, by
definition, are diseases that hit only a tiny segment of the population."
Rough figures

In the United States, the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 defines the term as any
disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the country, or
about one in 1,500 people.
"The 15 million figure often cited for China is a rough estimate at best, since
we have no official definition for 'rare diseases' and have conducted no
comprehensive census on the number of sufferers.
Wang Yi'ou is the founder of the Beijing-based NGO China-Dolls Center For Rare
Disorders.
After suffering repeated fractures since 1, Wang was diagnosed with
osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, at the age of 16.
Hitting one per 20,000 live births, the congenital disease gives its victims
defective connective tissue, rendering them petite "China dolls" with stunted
growth and fragile bones.
It was not meant for her son, who had brittle bone
disease, but for herself and her husband, the heartbroken mother told us."
"She said, 'It kills my son to be reminded that he's a rare-disease patient.
"Telling from my own experience, the boy's denial of his own condition, and by
extension himself, has stemmed in large part from the evasiveness adopted by his
entire family against the disease.
Wang's organization is one of the major Chinese beneficiaries of donations from
the popular Ice Bucket Challenge campaign helping sufferers of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis disease.
Zheng Yu, whose 15-year-old daughter, Gu Ruofan, first showed signs of a rare
disease called mucopolysaccharidosis in kindergarten, believes that an adult
very often fails to gauge the grit of a minor.
"My girl was diagnosed at 4, but we kept it from her for another four years,
until 2007, when I took her to a symposium in Taiwan focused on the disease.
If acknowledging the stark reality of a rare disease represents the first step
forward, then what comes next should be opening up to the world around, said
Meng Yan, a genetic disease expert from the 301 Hospital in Beijing.
"A rare-disease child, especially those with conspicuous physical changes, draws
confidence from his loved ones to face up to the inquisitive stares he or she is
certain to encounter out on the streets," she said.
A sense of regimen

A rare-disease child who has decided to "go out" is almost certain to suffer
occasional emotional pain, said Zheng, who insists that her daughter goes to
school.
"For anyone, with or without a disease, respect is something to be earned," she
said.
Yet no love should stand in the way of parents taking disciplinary action
against their "rare kids", conceded Zhao Ning, whose 8-year-old daughter was
diagnosed with phenylketonuria, a metabolic genetic disorder, upon birth.
Sufferers of the disease lack in their body a special type of enzyme necessary
for metabolizing amino acid.
"The idea that your rare-disease child needs to take no responsibility for his
or her health is a myth, and encourages nothing but self-pity," said Zhao, whose
daughter, apart from attending regular schools, has learned to play music and
even swim.
"It's up to parents to instill in their kids a strong sense of regimen, which
they then need to plan their lives around their disease."
"I understand all the concerns a 'rare parent' has in not having another child,
but my little one is working miracles on her elder sister.
"Worldwide, nearly 7,000 different types of rare diseases have been identified.
"If anything, the stark reality has made it more crucial for parents to remember
that your rare child has a life to explore, whatever its length.
They are
responsible for laying the very first brick for the bridge of understanding
between a rare kid and his disease, between him and the rest of the world."
Early this year, Li got an email from the mother of another child suffering from
Rett syndrome, from overseas.

Rare disease leaves girl in hospital for nine months

Vosloo, a single mother, moved to Glenwood from Ballito to be close to
seven-year-old Mineâ[#x20ac][TM] after she was diagnosed with a rare disease
â[#x20ac]" atypical haemolytic syndrome (HUS) â[#x20ac]" and where she waits in
hope for a new drug that will stabilise her for a kidney transplant.
She is one
of two children in South Africa living with the disease.
Mineâ[#x20ac][TM] has been living in the Durban hospital since November 2009,
where she has regular dialysis and blood cleaning (plasmapheresis) treatment.
â[#x20ac]oeWhen we stop plasmapheresis, after a few weeks the disease gets
active and her haemoglobin and platelets drop.
Syndrome

Doctors then diagnosed her with regular haemolytic syndrome (HUS) which is
caused by an infection, which is commonly from a bacteria called Escherichia
coli but in SA is caused by the bacteria Shigella dysenteriae type one that
presents with bloody diarrhoea (dysentery).
It was Bhimma who discovered
she had a genetic type of the disease â[#x20ac]" atypical haemolytic syndrome.
â[#x20ac]oeThe child has a rare disorder due to a mutation in a set of genes
that control the complement system.
It is often inherited as an autosomal

sporadic,â[#x20ac] Bhimma said.
But even after the kidney

Novartis' Ilaris Receives FDA Nod for Three Rare Diseases

LENGTH: 220 words

DATELINE: U.S.


U.S., Sept. 26 -- According to a recent report, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has given green light to three novel expanded indications for Ilaris
(canakinumab), which is the first once-a-month (4 weeks) injection approved by
the FDA for active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in children
aged two and above.
The new indications are tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic
syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS) or Mevalonate Kinase
Deficiency (MKD) and familial mediterranean fever (FMF).
The three syndromes are
hereditary diseases and characterized by periodic attacks of fever and
inflammation, and serious muscle pain.
The novel indications are for rare and severe auto-inflammatory diseases among
adults and pediatric patients.
Reportedly, Ilaris was previously granted an
approval for another periodic fever syndrome known as Cryopyrin-Associated
Periodic Syndromes (CAPS - a group of rare, inherited and autoinflammatory
diseases).
The treatment is manufactured and distributed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals
Corporation.

BRITISH doctors treating twin babies dying of a rare disease have been forced to
experiment with a risky new technique on one of the boys after failing to find a
suitable bone marrow donor.
Alex and Oscar, who are half-Chinese, half-Slovakian, have Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome which means they are vulnerable to the slightest infection.
It is the first time doctors in Britain have experimented with the new procedure
in treating the syndrome.
Mr Chan, 35, whose parents come from Hong Kong, said the treatment had had a 50
per cent success rate in Germany.

6 Rare Illnesses That Hollywood Has Put in the Spotlight -- and 1 It Hasn't
(Yet)

A version of this story first appeared in the Sept. 19 issue of The Hollywood
Reporter magazine.
Only
one in 3,000 newborns has the condition.
For those touched by the 6,800-plus classified rare (or orphan) diseases, each
occurring in fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, access to such
powerful platforms is vital.
Mass celebrity participation in the ALS Ice Bucket
Challenge has helped drive more than $112 million in donations to research a
disease that afflicts 30,000 Americans.
That campaign has been the exception: "A
lot of these diseases go underfunded, and [researchers] never find a cure for
them," says Brillstein manager Andrea Pett-Joseph, whose son Brandon has
epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a rare disorder that causes extremely fragile skin.
"The entertainment industry can be helpful in getting [rare diseases] the
attention and funds they need," says UTA CEO Jeremy Zimmer, whose friend Wendy
Landes died in 2013 of liposarcoma, an uncommon soft-tissue cancer.
That's because a significant number of rare diseases are caused by single-gene
mutations that are relatively less complex to investigate, says Jill Wood.
Such
disorders include her son Jonah's Sanfilippo syndrome, a metabolic disease that
leads to central nervous system degeneration.
But Sanfilippo syndrome is too rare to attract the sponsorship
of a large pharmaceutical firm, so Wood and her husband, Jeremy Weishaar,
founded the charity Jonah's Just Begun to raise money.
"I didn't want to wait until it was my kid that has a rare disease," Miller
says.
Because of their
rarity, research on orphan diseases is limited by small sample sizes.
They're
working with Baylor oncologist Dr. Melissa Bondy to investigate evidence that
Ashkenazi Jews are more likely to get the disease and hope to identify more
affected families "who can help unravel the puzzle," Hadley says.
Educating the public on the existence of certain rare diseases also can help
correct tragic misdiagnoses.
Janice McLaughlin's daughters Marissa and Mahrynn
suffered from an unknown neurological disease for more than a decade before a
genetic breakthrough last year finally identified their ailment: HBSL, a brain
disorder of which Marissa and Mahrynn have the only two known cases in America.
"Working in television, where things are so rapidly paced, it was
challenging to do my job and maintain insurance while my daughter was fighting
for her life," says Aaron Hammersley, a Disney storyboard artist whose daughter
Hazel was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer, last year.
Fiona has a rare disease of her own:
amniotic band syndrome, a condition in the womb that left her with just three
developed fingers and a club foot.
The Ashes have vowed to take every opportunity to spread awareness about their
daughters' rare diseases.
"I don't want to cash in those brownie points when there's nothing in
place [for researching my daughter's disease]," he says.
She has been diagnosed with Klein Levin syndrome or more known as the Sleeping
Beauty syndrome.
This is a very rare disease because only 1,000 cases have been
diagnosed worldwide.
Louisa Ball's sleeping beauty syndrome
has greatly affected her life.
Physicians believe that the sleeping beauty syndrome is caused by some sort of
viral infection.
Let's hope that the experts may find a way to cure the sleeping
beauty syndrome.

tumors.
"The addition of two novel, late-stage investigational compounds for the
treatment of rare endocrine disorders, DG3173 and ATL1103, coupled with our
existing Phase 3 asset for endogenous Cushing's Syndrome, COR-003, establishes
the cornerstone of Cortendo's rare endocrine disease franchise and demonstrates
our commitment to becoming a leader in providing innovative therapeutic options
to patients with rare diseases," said Matthew Pauls, president and chief
executive officer of Cortendo.
"There are significant unmet needs in the
diagnosis and treatment of both endogenous Cushing's Syndrome and acromegaly,
and we are passionate about the opportunity to simultaneously advance
development of COR-003, DG3173 and ATL1103 and commence pre-commercialization
activities, and to ultimately provide these patients and the physicians who
treat them with novel therapeutic options," Pauls added.
The financing is subject to shareholder approval of the AGM, which is scheduled
to be held on or about June 24, 2015, and is subject to certain other
conditions, including expected gross proceeds of at least $20 million and the
non-occurrence of any material adverse effects (as defined in the agreement with
the investors) prior to completion.
"We appreciate the support of all of our investors and their confidence in
Cortendo's ability to develop and commercialize novel therapeutics for the
treatment of rare endocrine disorders and other rare diseases," said Matthew

Federal regulators have put millions of women at increased risk of getting toxic
shock syndrome by failing to come up with a uniform system for rating tampon
absorbency, says the head of a public health advocacy group.
Meanwhile scientists at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta say they've
confirmed that higher-absorbency tampons increase the risk of toxic shock
syndrome, and that absorbency may be a greater factor than the materials sed to
make the tampons.
Dr. Claire V. Broome, one of the CDC researchers, said women must balance the
convenience of high-absorbency tampons against "reducing the risk somewhat of a
very rare disease.
"We're talking about only 2 cases per 100,000 menstruating women per year, which
is a rare disease," she said in a telephone interview.
The CDC researchers reviewed 285 cases of tampon-associated toxic shock syndrome
that occurred in 1983 and 1984 and found that increasing absorbency increased a
woman's odds of getting the syndrome, regardless of the material the tampon is
made of.
Use of the lowest absorbency tampon Tampax Regular - was associated with 4.7
times higher odds of getting the syndrome than use of no tampon.
"

A total of 2,962 cases of toxic shock syndrome have been reported since it was
first documented in 1978, and 127 cases have been fatal, Dr. Broome said.

Need info on rare diseases?

After several years of tests and consultations with specialists, you finally
learn the diagnosis: You or someone you know has a rare, hereditary condition
that strikes just one in 20,000 people.
Finally, how can you join a support group for
this condition, when those affected are so few and far between?
People with so-called rare disorders are often in desperate need of information
about treatment, research advances and, in many cases, simple, basic knowledge
about their condition, says Maureen Gaetz-Faubert, who founded the Canadian
Organization for Rare Disorders in 1995.
After all, would you expect your doctor to know about Goodpasture Syndrome or
Maple Syrup Urine Disease?
Would you expect your doctor or pharmacist to provide
much information about bullous pemphigoid, a rare, autoimmune, chronic skin
disorder that involves blistering?
We tend to underestimate the overall impact of these illnesses and conditions,
Ms. Gaetz-Faubert adds.
"There are about 6,000 rare disorders [defined as
affecting fewer than one in 20,000 people].
She herself has Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a connective-tissue disease that causes
fatigue, pain and poor immune functioning.
Ms. Gaetz-Faubert's situation illustrates the first major obstacle faced by a
person with a rare disorder: getting a proper diagnosis.
According to one U.S.
survey, it can take up to five years for patients with rare diseases to be
correctly diagnosed.
Even then, appropriate care and treatment are often delayed
until specialized clinical programs and professionals are tracked down.
Accurate information is key to getting appropriate referrals, avoiding
unnecessary tests and receiving proper, timely treatment.
That's why
rare-disease patients often become experts - by necessity - on their own
situation.
Fortunately for today's health consumer, the Internet offers a vast amount of
health information, including these helpful Web sites on rare disorders:

Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders (www.cord.ca/) - With a database of
about 150 patient-support groups and disease-specific agencies across Canada,
CORD can link you with others who share your health concerns.
National Organization for Rare Disorders, Inc. (www.rarediseases.org/) - This
U.S. federation of more than 140 voluntary health organizations offers extensive
information, including three searchable databases - for 1,100 rare diseases, for
more than 1,200 organizations, and for 900 so-called orphan drugs.
Office of Rare Diseases (http://raredisease.info.nih.gov/ord/) - The U.S.
National Institutes of Health provide this Web site, which features information
on 6,000 rare diseases, current research, genetics information and support
groups.
Rare Genetic Diseases in Children
(http://mcrcr2.med.nyu.edu/murphp01/homenew.htm) - A directory of Web sites from
organizations and individuals on genetic diseases or disease families.
IODE Genetics Resource Centre, based at the London Health Science Centre in
London, Ont., provides free information for consumers and doctors on genetically
based diseases (which account for the majority of rare disorders).
For information, call (416) 324-9191

Why some people are medically disenfranchised

   Unlike diseases that strike large numbers of people, those that affect just a
tiny minority are poorly funded when it comes to research, new drug development
and genetic testing.
Research: Funding is hard to obtain because money generally flows to study
diseases with a greater impact on public health.
Also, it's complicated to
organize a randomized, controlled trial for a rare condition because the people
being studied are often scattered over a wide geographical area.
"An estimated 20 million Americans with more than 5,000 rare disorders find
themselves medically disenfranchised, and falling through the cracks of the
health-care system, because their afflictions are not identified as major
public-health threats warranting targeted research efforts," writes Abbey
Meyers, executive director of the U.S. National Organization for Rare Disorders.
However, new computer technology is making it easier to recruit patients for
studies of rare diseases.
Recently, doctors and computer experts at the Mayo
Medical School Clinic and Foundation in Rochester, Minn., developed a
computer-based disease-tracking system that can identify all patients with a
particular disease and enter their information into a secure, central database.
Although the system was specifically developed to study Mayo Clinic patients
with cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer of the bile ducts, the researchers say
the software could be applied more broadly to facilitate clinical trials of rare
disorders.
Drugs: Pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to focus on rare diseases when
developing new drugs because of the small number of patients and limited
potential for profit.
Genetic therapies: As the genes for rare disorders are discovered, more affected
families will seek testing.
However, as with drugs, genetic tests and therapies
for rare diseases are often scientifically possible but not commercially viable.
Maddi has a rare - in fact an ultra-rare -condition that affects only a handful
of people in the country.
Sanfilippo syndrome, a condition that means the
sufferer's body cannot process sugar molecules properly, is incurable.
However, research is taking place which, one hopes, will shed light on the
syndrome and lead to ways of mitigating it.
However, new rules brought in by the
National Institute of Clinical Excellence, which issues guidelines on which
treatments should be available on the NHS, has revealed it is tightening its
criteria for funding drugs for rare diseases.
For example, the driver behind
the change is the cost per quality adjusted life year' - a mechanism that
naturally discriminates against those with rare diseases as there are fewer
people who may benefit, so costs are naturally higher.
A decade ago Ms Basham had surgery to remove her gall bladder but months later
she was diagnosed with acute renal failure and a life-threatening disease known
as atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
``Two weeks post-diagnosis I was undergoing three hours of plasma exchange
followed by four-hour dialysis and blood transfusion treatment every day,'' she
said.
The syndrome, which affects kidney function, is what doctors call an ultra-rare
disease as it affects just two in one million Australians.
``A nurse was the first person to discuss the disease with me,'' the Bayview
Heights resident said.
Now, at 52 years of age, Ms Basham spends five days a week on dialysis and is
injected with a drug called Soliris - the only treatment available for syndrome
patients.
The drug underwent clinical trials in the US and UK to halt the
disease's progression.
While the treatment is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration the drug
is not funded through the Federal Government's Life Saving Drugs Program.
``It's ridiculous that there is a treatment available in Australia .
Using the treatment means Ms Basham is eligible for a new kidney.
The Life
Saving Drugs Program was set up to subsidise expensive drugs for rare diseases
and currently funds 10 drugs to treat seven diseases.

One woman's pain of living with Parkinson's disease for 12 years

Matilda Nakkazi, 53, is a mother of 10.
For the past 12 years, however, she has been battling
Parkinson's disease, a neurological syndrome which characterised by constant
shaking of the thumbs and fingers, and constant rigid muscles.
It is a disorder
of the central nervous system, and this disease normally affects people who are
over the age of 50.
For the past 12 years, however, she has been battling Parkinson's disease, a
neurological syndrome which characterised by constant shaking of the thumbs and
fingers, and constant rigid muscles.
It is a disorder of the central nervous system, and this disease normally
affects people who are over the age of 50.
Before a diagnosis was carried out at Mulago hospital, Nakkazi thought she had
been bewitched since doctors had initially failed to diagnose her condition.
Dr Simon Peter Eyoku from Mulago hospital explains that Parkinson's disease is a
rare disease whose specific cause is not exactly known, although a few cases
have been attributed to genetic factors.
In Uganda, because it is a rare
disease, it is not known how many people suffer from the condition.
Dr Eyoku reveals that although there is no cure for Parkinson's disease,
medications, surgery and palliative care can offer relief from some of the
symptoms that are commonly associated with the condition.
Levodopa drugFor some patients, a drug called Levodopa can be used to manage
symptoms, and in Uganda, it has so far been the most common drug used.
Dr Eyoku
adds that surgery is no longer commonly used in managing Parkinson's disease.
PreventionDr Eyoku however explains that Parkinson's disease can be prevented if
the affected persons drink caffeine, commonly found it coffee, tea and cola.
Green tea also may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease.
Dr Eyoku further explains that consuming foods rich in flavonoids, such as
berries, apples, orange juice and red wine are also known to reduce the risk of
developing Parkinson's disease by 35 per cent.
Research has also linked the development of Parkinson's disease reduced
oestrogen levels.
This may explain why menopausal women who do not take hormone replacement
therapy are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease.
Nakkazi is currently receiving treatment at Mulago hospital, and says she has
kept a strong faith in God, and believes that one day she will be healed of her
condition.

Scientists from Washington University and the University of Pennsylvania have
used gene therapy in dogs to cure a rare genetic disease that affects multiple
body organs.
In humans, the disease is called
Sly syndrome - named for Dr. William Sly, a doctor at St. Louis University who
first diagnosed the disease in 1973.
Other researchers have used gene therapy in dogs to target diseases that affect
a single body function, such as vision or blood clotting, but the 17-month study
published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is the
first to report successful treatment for a disease that affects many different
organs, Haskins said.
Sly syndrome is a disease caused by a lack of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase.
People with the disease have stunted growth, mental retardation and
trouble moving.
The disease affects about one in
27,000 babies born in the United States.
Although rare, the disease is a good model for treating other storage diseases,
such as Tay-Sachs disease, Sly said.
Ponder and other colleagues first used gene therapy to treat mice with the MPS
VII disease.
But researchers have rarely been
able to use the rodent cures to treat larger animals or people, she said.
The scientists then injected newborn puppies affected with the MPS VII disease
with the engineered retrovirus.
The liver cells made enough of the enzyme to correct the disease
throughout the body.
The
dogs didn't develop the serious heart and eye problems normally found in dogs
with the disease.
The technique could be used to cure many other lysosomal storage diseases, which
affect about one of every 7,000 babies born, Sly said.

Feb. 07--HIGH POINT -- The morning she was diagnosed with a rare terminal
illness, Ann Current didn't have room for fear -- she was too filled with
relief.
Restless leg syndrome.
She'd been to countless doctors and received a wide range of diagnoses --
everything from essential tremor and Parkinson's disease to fibromyalgia and
asthma -- none of which turned out to be accurate.
So that morning in May 2012, when a neurologist at UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill
looked Current in the eye and told her she had multiple system atrophy, or MSA,
she and her husband Mike couldn't help but be relieved, despite the little-known
disease's grim prognosis.
"She said, 'It's rare, but I'm 95-percent sure you have it,'" Current says.
And then she said, 'I have to tell you that it's probably what will kill you,
because it's fatal -- there's no cure and there's no treatment.'"
According to the MSA Coalition -- a nonprofit organization that helps fund MSA
research and educates patients and caregivers -- MSA is "a rare, degenerative
neurologic condition that affects both men and women, usually starting in the
50s or early 60s.
First identified in 1962, the condition was initially named Shy-Drager syndrome
for two doctors who reported patients exhibiting "a combination of
Parkinson-like movement disorders and problems with the autonomic, or
body-regulating division of the nervous system," the MSA Coalition states.
It's an uphill battle, Current knows, because of the rareness of MSA.
The only celebrity she's heard of who was diagnosed
with MSA was celebrity chef Kerry Simon, who died of the disease in September.
The year after her diagnosis, she posted
something on Facebook every day in March -- MSA Awareness Month -- to educate
her friends about the disease.

PatientCrossroads Fuels Development of New National Clinical Research Network

LENGTH: 828  words


July 14 -- PatientCrossroads issued the following news release:


PatientCrossroads, pioneer of the groundbreaking CONNECT patient registry
platform, announced that three PatientCrossroads-based patient
registries-DuchenneConnect, for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies; the
Phelan-McDermid Syndrome International Registry; and the NephCure Kidney
Network, for primary Nephrotic Syndrome-have been awarded contracts by the
Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) as part of the creation of
a new health data network called PCORnet: the National Patient-Centered Clinical
Research Network.
PCORI has invested more than $100 million to support 29 individual health data
networks that will comprise PCORnet, a large, national network for conducting
more efficient clinical outcomes research that addresses questions of greatest
concern to patients and those who care for them.
"PatientCrossroads' vision aligns perfectly with PCORnet, which is intended to
provide patients, families and healthcare providers with key information
required to make crucial decisions about which preventive, diagnostic or
treatment approach is best suited to patients' needs and circumstances," said
Kyle Brown, founder of PatientCrossroads.
DuchenneConnect is an established patient-report
registry with seven years of experience collecting longitudinal patient-reported
data that is used by industry, clinical and academic researchers working on
advances in the rare diseases of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy.
"DuchenneConnect has become a model for rare-disease registries, and we look
forward to the benefits for our community, and for the nation, from PCORI's
PCORnet effort," said Holly Peay, vice president of education and outreach for
PPMD and DuchenneConnect Principal Investigator, "Many of DuchenneConnect's
achievements through this program will become available to other disease
registries under the PatientCrossroads model, thereby extending the reach of
PCORnet to a broader range of patient networks.
The Phelan-McDermid Syndrome Foundation will establish the Phelan-McDermid
Syndrome Data Network (PMS_DN) in partnership with researchers at Harvard
Medical School's Center for Biomedical Informatics.
Their $950,000 award from
PCORI will expand the utility of the existing patient registry by integrating
family-reported information with concepts generated from electronic health
records of patients affected by Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, in addition to other
medical reports, in a unified data system.
The PMS_DN will enable researcher
access to de-identified family information in a way that supports never-before
available hypothesis generation and testing for Phelan-McDermid Syndrome and
expedites research into meaningful health outcomes for the Phlelan-McDermid
Syndrome community.
"Involvement in PCORnet as a Patient-Powered Research Network has provided our
Foundation an unprecedented platform to enrich data about our patient population
and critical new collaborations in the promotion of patient and family
leadership in research," said Megan O'Boyle, Principal Investigator for the
PMS_DN at the Phelan-McDermid Syndrome Foundation.
"With PCORI and our partners
at Harvard Medical School, we will elevate the value of patient and family
reported data by weaving it together with clinical and genomics data to advance
a 'whole person, whole family, whole community' research agenda for
Phelan-McDermid Syndrome and we expect, related conditions."
The NephCure Foundation is the only organization
committed exclusively to supporting research and seeking the cause of the
potentially debilitating kidney diseases collectively known as Primary Nephrotic
Syndrome (NS), which includes Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Minimal
Change Disease (MCD) and Membranous Nephropathy (MN).
"As a secure data network, PCORnet is designed to provide access to a large
amount of diverse and relevant health information that can focus research on
questions and outcomes especially useful to patients and those who care for
them," said Marilyn Hailperin, Research Director for the NephCure Foundation.
"PCORI's support will enable us to expand and enhance our NephCure Kidney
Network to facilitate the rapid development and execution of comparative
effectiveness research to benefit patents with Primary Nephrotic Syndrome.

Rare diseases pose some very troubling questions

BYLINE: Alberni Valley Times

SECTION: HEALTH; Pg.
Her son's rare disorder has inflated his right leg with aggressive, but benign,
tumours that can't be removed with surgery.
Lapointe, who has taken a year off from her teaching career to scour the
Internet for potential treatments, has spent more than $20,000 in pursuit of
experimental therapies in the U.S. and Canada.
"It's a rare disease: There is nothing for it.
Such is the plight of those with rare or "orphan" diseases.
By definition, orphan diseases affect fewer than one in 20,000 people.
They
often have mysterious names, Alpha-1 and XLH, or names that defy memory -
Wegener's Granulomatosis and Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome.
But there are also
familiar names among the orphans, diseases known for their tragedies and
telethons: cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and hemophilia.
In all, more than
6,000 orphan diseases have been identified and as many as three million
Canadians now suffer from one.
Yet most people with orphan diseases are treated only with horribly blunt
instruments.
The dearth of drug treatments for them is a reflection of basic
economics.
Recognizing that fact, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Singapore
and Australia all have orphan drug legislation that allocates public money and
offers government incentives to foster research into orphan diseases and their
treatment.
Orphan disease sufferers in Canada, brought together through the Internet, are
demanding change.
"We need to be recognized," says Maureen Gaetz-Faubert, founder of the Canadian
Organization for Rare Diseases (CORD), a lobby and support group that operates
out of her home in Lethbridge, Alta.
CORD wants Health Minister Anne McLellan to direct research money into orphan
diseases, improve access to new drugs and, when necessary, make those drugs more
affordable.
Many of the new drugs designed to treat rare diseases are astronomically
expensive.
Cerezyme, a drug used to treat Gaucher's Disease, costs $300,000 a
year, while Prolastin, a drug used in the treatment of Alpha-1, can cost $40,000
to $50,000 a year.
Gaetz-Faubert contends these drugs comprise basic health care
for people with rare diseases - and that more of them need to be subsidized.
There's now a hodgepodge of provincial drug insurance coverage that vexes many
orphan disease sufferers.
Are the needs of orphan disease sufferers
being met in Canada?
Is it enough for Canada to piggyback on U.S. efforts to
produce new drugs for those with orphan diseases?
"I don't think our government realizes there are three million Canadians
affected by rare disorders," says Gaetz-Faubert, who suffers from a rare disease
known as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
Drugs designed to treat orphan diseases are dwarfed by what's available on
pharmacy shelves for common afflictions.
Arthritis patients have at least 18
medications to choose from to treat their pain and inflammation.
It is essential corporate mathematics: Inventing
another drug to treat high cholesterol is going to be tremendously more
profitable than the first drug to treat Desmoid Tumours or XLH, a genetic
disease that impairs the body's ability to make and maintain bone.
Most of
that money will go toward breast cancer, AIDs and heart disease research.
It's
impossible to determine how much of that will go toward orphan diseases because
no money is committed specifically to them.
CIHR spokeswoman Faye Kert said there are no quotas for cancer, heart disease or
orphan diseases.
Whartons Primary School pupil Sam Brown, six, suffers from an extremely rare,
inherited genetic disease called Morquio Syndrome.
The condition, which only affects one in every 250,000 people in the UK, causes
progressive physical disability and shortness of stature, and is significantly
life limiting.
His parents, Katy and Simon, say the treatment - which can slow or halt the
disease's progression - has made a massive difference.
"But every indication we have been given thus far is that the funding will not
be approved by NHS England, which means his treatment would stop and the disease
would be allowed to progress.
"In addition, it has emerged that the scorecard system used by NHS England to
appraise drugs for funding actively discriminates against very rare diseases.
"There are only 88 people in the UK suffering from Morquio Syndrome and, as it
stands, this means it will be impossible for them to access any kind of
treatment."
She is urging everyone to get behind an online petition, which sports a
photograph of Sam, that has been started by the MPS Society to demand that the
NHS provides treatment for people with very rare conditions.
"He has no idea of the silent path Morquio Syndrome has set for his future.
"He did not choose to be born with a very rare disease.

Ottawa weighing costs of treating rare disease

Mackenzie Olsen is just one of dozens of rare disease patients in Canada who are
left without treatment, and perhaps a future, because the government has no
strategy for funding costly but potentially life-saving therapies.
Genetic disorder

The nine-year-old Alberta boy, who suffers from an unusual genetic disorder
called Hurler-Schele syndrome, must wait until at least July for Ottawa to
decide if it will pay for his $17,000 per week enzyme replacement therapy.
Eventually fatal

Hurler-Schele syndrome, caused by a lack of a certain enzyme called
aL-iduronidase, is eventually fatal, but first causes loss of sight, hearing and
speech, as well as swelling of organs such as the heart and lungs.
Mackenzie's parents can't fathom why their boy won't be covered for the
treatment when another child is receiving money from Health Canada for the same
drug to treat a different condition.
"It's not only our son, there are other children out there suffering with this
same disease that are being cut off, if they haven't been cut off already.
When asked Wednesday if there's anything he'll do to help the boy, Health
Minister Ujjal Dosanjh said he's "not God" and the treatment must be assessed by
a common drug review before the government decides if it's cost-effective to
supply.
Mackenzie's treatment, which should be covered by the First Nations Inuit Health
Branch, is just one of several similar therapies caught up in the government's
new drug review process and unavailable to most patients in the interim.
Enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry's disease patients - called Fabrazyme - was
put through the review in the fall but rejected because it didn't meet
cost-effective standards.
After an outpouring of opposition from patients, the
$300,000-a-year treatment was sent for a second review, expected to end in May.
But in Alberta, the government has offered its 15 Fabry's patients a "bridging
program" to cover their treatment until a permanent funding decision is made.
Rare disease specialist Dr. Joe Clarke at the Hospital for Sick Children says
the government's position calls into question one of the cornerstones of
Canada's health-care system - accessibility.
If you happen to be born with a rare disease,
you do not have the same access to new, groundbreaking treatments as people who
have more common diseases.
And in fact, simply by being rare, you may not be
treated at all, ever," Clarke said.
A handful of his MPS I patients in Toronto stopped their Aldurazyme treatments
when clinical trials finished.

A costly second chance for little Isaac;
With Ontario now funding an expensive new treatment, a two-year-old is
flourishing despite his rare disease, LISA PRIEST writes

BYLINE: LISA PRIEST

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg.
It's one of several
checks done each hour he undergoes treatment for his rare disease.
It is that of a preschooler thriving
after receiving one of the most expensive drugs in the world - Naglazyme - the
only treatment for Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, an inherited metabolic disorder.
The bag of colourless medicine, not even a cupful, costs the public health-care
system $5,000 to $6,000 for each weekly treatment, something he will require, in
some form or another, for the rest of his life.
A few months ago, the future looked bleak for Isaac, who has
mucopolysaccharidosis type VI, or MPS VI for short, a disease so rare it's
estimated that only three to 10 Canadians have it.
He had already suffered some of the ill effects of the disease: a piece of his
skull and a portion of vertebrae in his neck were removed after they began
compressing his spinal cord.
In July, the provincial government decided to fund the drug for Isaac after a
clinical review by members of Ontario's inherited-metabolic-diseases program.
"We're hoping that it will correct the
metabolic abnormalities sufficiently so that the disease won't progress."
Signs of the disease include stunted growth, enlarged tonsils and adenoids that
cause breathing problems, poor mobility and dramatic changes in facial features,
including a flat nose and large head.
"Isaac is the youngest patient I've ever seen with the condition, so we have to
consider him to be programmed to have more severe disease," Dr. Clarke said.
Although the drug won't necessarily reverse the damage the disease has already
done, it will help halt its progression.
She is concerned about Canada's lack of an orphan drug policy, as is Durhane
Wong-Rieger, president of the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders.
"There is widespread agreement that we need to provide some treatment for rare
disorders," Dr. Wong-Rieger said.
Since Isaac began receiving treatment in September, his life has turned around.

The girl in 50 million;
Niamh Stirling might outwardly look just like any other typical teen, but she
has to deal with a rare illness which makes her...
The schoolgirl, whose parents
come from Northern Ireland, suffers from Dubowitz syndrome.
Precisely, she is a
girl in 50,000,000, one of only 148 recorded people worldwide with Dubowitz
syndrome, the only known case on the island of Ireland.
And both
parents carry the rare rogue gene.
So rare is this gene that their chances of
meeting are almost incalculable.
Dubowitz syndrome is a rare mutation in an
inherited gene, characterised by neurodevelopmental disorder, short stature, and
eczema.
A good night's sleep is Doctors were baffled: on
one occasion Niamh, at six months, was wheeled into the hospital amphitheatre
where 200 medical students were invited to discuss her condition.
"What the
minister here fails to grasp is that this syndrome is for life.
Yearly Niamh faces yet new and
emerging problems related to her overall 'condition' - a word, she and her
parents deliberately chose to use.
"One
neighbour has prune belly - [affecting the abdominal muscles] - and he is only
10 and the latest addition to the road, she has Downs Syndrome."
Then says: "My wish would be not to be sick...'' rare diseases are not so
uncommon ?
A rare disease is defined by the European Union as one that affects
less than five in 10,000 of the general population.
The vast majority of rare
diseases will affect far fewer than this - some will affect only a handful, or
even a single person in the whole of the country ?
There are between 6,000 and
8,000 known rare diseases.
Around five new rare diseases are described in
medical literature each week.
80% of rare diseases have a genetic component.
Often rare diseases are life-threatening.
Rare diseases can be single gene,
multifactorial, chromosomal or non-genetic.
75% of rare diseases affect
children, and 30% of rare disease patients die before their fifth birthday.

Rare disease means constant care

Apert syndrome is a disease most people have never heard of.
As the Camden
Venetian Mayoral Ball gets closer, Kerrie Armstrong spoke to a specialist about
what the disease is and how it is treated.
THE odds of Adriana Gatteleri, 13, of Bringelly, developing Apert syndrome were
incredibly low.
Only one baby in 100,000 to 200,000 in Australia will develop the syndrome,
which is a genetic mutation.
Money to help Adriana's family with the cost of her treatment will be raised at
the Camden Venetian Mayoral Ball, sponsored by the Advertiser.
The doctor who oversees Adriana's extremely specialised care, Adelaide-based
craniomaxillofacial surgery specialist David David, said the care Apert syndrome
patients needed had improved over the past 40 years.
"Thirty or 40 years ago patients with Apert syndrome were considered severely
retarded," said Professor David, the head of the Australian Craniofacial Unit
and professor of craniomaxillofacial surgery at the University of Adelaide.
Professor David said the treatment of the syndrome required management of the
patient from birth through to maturity, including at least two major surgeries
to allow the brain to grow and expand and help newborn patients to breathe.
"Now about 60 per cent of patients can live independent lives, but they require
a lot of multi-faceted care."
He said his Adelaide-based unit gave patients a multi-faceted patient-centred
approach to treatment, giving them the opportunity to speak to all of their
doctors at once and to get the full picture of their condition.
The centre has treated about 160 patients since is was established 40 years ago
with treatment often concluding once the patient was in their mid-20s.

about girl's rare genetic disorder

BYLINE: Stephanie Bell

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.
She was just three months old when diagnosed with Williams Syndrome, a condition
thought to affect only 24 people in Northern Ireland.
Since then, her devoted
family have found that living with a rare disease means learning as you go
along.
"After tests there we were told she had Williams Syndrome which was such a
shock.
It is a rare genetic disorder which means sufferers are missing chromosome
seven, elastin.
The condition is usually diagnosed because of high levels of
calcium in the blood or as in Kara's case, through a heart defect.
Most of what the family know about the syndrome they have read online and Kerry
has found a family support group on Facebook which she has found invaluable.
CHALLENGES Life does present both her and her family with challenges and because
so little is known about the syndrome, Kerry and Patrick do not know what to
expect.

Programs at 2016 NORD Rare Diseases, Orphan Products Breakthrough Summit

LENGTH: 1757  words


Oct. 11 -- Soligenix, Inc. (OTCQB: SNGXD) (Soligenix or the Company), a
late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing
products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced
today that it has been invited to present preliminary results from two programs
at National Organization for Rare Disorders' (NORD's) Rare Diseases and Orphan
Products Breakthrough Summit on October 17-18, 2016 in Arlington, VA.
The presented results will be available for viewing throughout the conference
and will address preclinical efficacy findings in two programs that have
previously been granted orphan drug designation by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA):

* Dusquetide in the treatment of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS); and

* RiVax, a proprietary thermostable ricin toxin vaccine, for the prevention of
ricin intoxication.
Results from the Phase 2 study
recently demonstrated that dusquetide can reduce the duration of severe oral
mucositis, caused by the excessive inflammatory response of the innate immune
system to damage caused by chemoradiation, in head and neck cancer patients.
Poster Presentation Titles:

* An Innate Defense Regulator for the Treatment of Macrophage Activation
Syndrome: Preclinical Studies in an Orphan Indication

* Orphan Disease, Biodefense and the Animal Rule: A Thermostabilized Ricin Toxin
Vaccine

About the NORD Rare Disease and Orphan Products Breakthrough Summit

NORD's Rare Diseases and Orphan Products Breakthrough Summit features speakers
from the FDA, participation of patient organizations and the Pharma/Biotech
industry's foremost experts in orphan product innovation, investment and
commercialization.
More details about the conference can be found at
http://rarediseases.org/summit-overview/.
Preclinical efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in
numerous animal disease models including mucositis, colitis, melioidosis, MAS
and other bacterial infections.
Recently, SGX942 has
demonstrated preliminary efficacy and safety in an exploratory Phase 2 clinical
study in 111 patients with oral mucositis due to chemoradiation (CRT) therapy
for head and neck cancer.
In patients at highest risk of oral mucositis (e.g., those
exposed to the most aggressive concomitant chemotherapy), the reduction in the
duration of severe oral mucositis was even more significant at 67% when treated
with SGX942 1.5 mg/kg, from 30 days to 10 days (p=0.04).
Drug products containing dusquetide have also received Fast Track Designations
from the FDA for the treatment of oral mucositis as a result of radiation and/or
chemotherapy treatment in head and neck cancer patients, and as an adjunctive
therapy with other antibacterial drugs, for the treatment of melioidosis.
Orphan
Drug Designation for use of dusquetide in the treatment of MAS has also been
granted.
RiVax
is extremely labile in liquid form requiring careful management under
refrigerated conditions at 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit).
But what is unusual about this 4-year-old Azusa boy is that he has had 15 laser
treatments on his face and an operation for glaucoma.
Aiden has a rare neuro-

logical disorder called Sturge-Weber Syndrome that causes him to have seizures.
Like others with the syndrome, he was born with a large birthmark on his face
called a port wine stain.
Laser
treatments have lightened the stain from purple to pink.
She did research online and found that because the birthmark involved the
forehead and the right eyelid, it was likely her son had Sturge-Weber Syndrome.
There, he was diagnosed with Sturge-Weber Syndrome.
His first laser treatment to lighten the birthmark was when he was 4 months old.
There are no exact numbers on how many people have Sturge-Weber Syndrome.
"The isolation is a big problem for families" who deal with a rare disease,
Howard said.
A rare disease is anything with fewer than 200,000 cases.
Because Sturge-Weber is rare, Waters wants to spread awareness about it.
She would like to
tell them about Sturge-Weber Syndrome.
"It's just an unfortunate disease," she said.
"He's more than his syndrome.
Waters
has a rare disease called Struge-Weber syndromewhich causes seizures and other
neurological symptoms.

There's solace in numbers in the world of rare diseases

BYLINE: Morgan Morris

LENGTH: 1869 words


In the world of rare diseases, the story of the Daniels family in Kraaifontein,
Cape Town, is probably typical.
For instance, it took parents Gail and Colin
Daniels more than 11 years to put a name to the condition -- cystinosis -- that
had dogged their daughter, Danielle, since birth.
It is a disease that has
stunted her growth, slowed her learning, made her a fixture in doctors' offices
and hospital wards and subjected her to a rigid diet of supplements and
boosters.
She suspected that her child had
rickets, a disease, common in Africa, that is characterised by the softening of
what are meant to be growing bones.
Narrowing down the condition But after months of tests, mad dashes to the
hospital, a string of specialists and a babble of misdiagnoses, doctors finally
narrowed down her condition to Fanconi syndrome.
Named after a Swiss
paediatrician, the syndrome affects the ducts or tubes leading from the kidney.
But in this syndrome the ducts are unable to do so and precious
glucose, carbohydrates, phosphates, amino acids and minerals are passed out in
the urine.
There is no cure for Fanconi syndrome.
Instead,
patients are put on a lifelong course of boosters, supplements, vitamins,
phosphate replacements and citrates to make up for the shortfall of minerals.
Also patients are commonly
lethargic, so learning is slow.
Naming
the disease Cystinosis borrows its name from a namesake gene, the cystinosis
gene.
Both parents, unaffected by the condition, have to carry the
faulty CTNS gene.
A childhood disease, cystinosis is
considered rare.
"A lot of children probably die from this condition
without it being diagnosed, especially in the developing world," said Dr Peter
Nourse, the paediatric nephrologist at Cape Town's Red Cross Children's Hospital
who treats Danielle.
With about 14 patients at Cape Town's Red Cross and
Tygerberg hospitals, Nourse has good reason to think that the disease is more
common than statistics bear out.
Treatment Although there is no cure for cystinosis, there is a
treatment in a drug called cysteamine.
Cystagon was developed as an orphan drug --
medication for rare diseases -- in the United States, where it has been
prescribed for cystinosis for the past 15 years.
Raptor Pharmaceuticals in the US is
making headway on a delayed-release version of the treatment, to be known as DR
Cysteamine.
After all, the markets for treatments for most
rare diseases are usually too small to coax companies to do the necessary R&D.
"Funding for rare diseases is very uneven," points out cystinosis guru Dr
William A Gahl, clinical director at the National Human Genome Research
Institute in Maryland in the US.
But
the condition piqued academic interest because of its "intriguing basis" as a
lysosomal transport defect, says Gahl.
Researchers hope that treatments for a
few dozen inherited metabolic disorders, also linked to faulty lysosomes, can be
developed on the back of cystinosis studies.
"By doing so, we'll have a more thorough picture of
cystinosis and its complications, providing our research teams with information
they so desperately need to discover novel treatments and a cure."
Gail is
mother hen to others in the South African group, largely state patients with no
medical aid.
"There is a treatment for cystinosis,"
says Hobbs-Hotz.
"We want the medical community to understand the disease so
they can make a proper diagnosis and for families to understand the disease and
the need for compliance."

A woman who was left wheelchair-bound after developing a number of rare diseases
is raising awareness of the life-changing conditions that have left her unable
to pick up a knife and suffering several seizures every day.
After falling ill, Miss Corner was diagnosed with functional neurological
disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, non-epileptic seizures, migraines, complex
regional pain syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome and blackouts.
The 34-year-old
now has several seizures a day and has had six operations on her right foot as a
result of her condition.

Four-year-old fights rare disease; Family holding walk to raise research funds

BYLINE: Jen Gerson, Calgary Herald

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.
Her daughter had a rare condition called Nephrotic Syndrome.
As treatment progressed, more bad news.
Most children with the disease grow out
of it and their organs recover.
But Sophia had FSGS - Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis - a designation that
indicates a progressively worsening condition.
Sophia has been in and out of hospital as treatment after treatment failed.
She held a walk in Toronto that raised $30,000 for NephCure, an organization
that raises awareness about the disease.
By holding a walk, Galbraith expects to raise more money for
research and possibly meet other local families who are coping with the rare
disease.
After all, her daughter and others like her will have a better shot at survival
if more people understand and direct research funds to nephrotic syndrome.
It's an experimental drug, normally used for lymphoma
patients and Galbraith doesn't know if it will work.
What they do know is that, after one treatment, Sophia is bouncing around - well
enough to play tennis at the local community centre.
Sophia has a rare disorder called Nephrotic Syndrome and Andrea is planning
Calgary's first NephCure walk in June.

Proteus syndrome
is a rare disease driven by the AKT1 mutation.
"We continue to be pleased with the robust rate of enrollment in the METIV-HCC
trial with tivantinib as second-line therapy in MET-high HCC patients," said
Paolo Pucci, chief executive officer of ArQule.
"Our AKT inhibitor, ARQ 092, is on track to
enroll its first patient in the third quarter in the Phase 1 trial in Proteus
syndrome, a rare disease that is caused by a mutation in the AKT1 gene.
Moreover, in the oncology portion of the ARQ 092 clinical program we have
observed five patients with confirmed partial responses, four of which came in
the Phase 1b enriched cohort and two of which had the same AKT1 mutation which
occurs in Proteus syndrome.
"In all of our studies, with tivantinib, ARQ 087 and ARQ 092, our strategy of
conducting biomarker driven clinical trials with small molecules in areas of
high unmet need demonstrates our leadership in precision medicine and more
importantly our commitment to deliver therapies for our patients on an expedited
basis," said Mr. Pucci.

who suffers from a very rare disease, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, and his desperate
father's unique endeavor to save his child.
HABETURK featured in its first page a baby, who had genetically heritable
Crigler-Najjar syndrome that only 202 people have in the world, struggling to
survive only through his poor family's creative combat.
VATAN said the baby's sister had the same disease, but was cured when her
mother, Zeliha, donated a piece of her liver 16 years ago to save her life.

Rare diseases fall through funding gap: Government won't cover $17,000-a-week
treatment for boy, 9, with genetic disorder

OTTAWA -- Mackenzie Olsen is just one of dozens of rare disease patients in
Canada who are left without treatment, and perhaps a future, because the
government has no strategy for funding costly but potentially life-saving
therapies.
The nine-year-old Alberta boy, who suffers from an unusual genetic disorder
called Hurler-Schele syndrome, must wait until at least July for Ottawa to
decide if it will pay for his $17,000 per week enzyme replacement therapy.
Hurler-Schele syndrome, caused by a lack of a certain enzyme called
aL-iduronidase, is eventually fatal, but first causes loss of sight, hearing and
speech, as well as swelling of organs such as the heart and lungs.
Mackenzie's parents can't fathom why their boy won't be covered for the
treatment when another child is receiving money from Health Canada for the same
drug to treat a different condition.
"It's not only our son, there are other children out there suffering with this
same disease that are being cut off, if they haven't been cut off already.
When asked Wednesday if there's anything he'll do to help the boy, Health
Minister Ujjal Dosanjh said he's "not God" and the treatment must be assessed by
a common drug review before the government decides if it's cost-effective to
supply.
Mackenzie's treatment, which should be covered by the First Nations Inuit Health
Branch, is just one of several similar therapies caught up in the government's
new drug review process and unavailable to most patients in the interim.
Enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry's disease patients -- called Fabrazyme --
was put through the review in the fall but rejected because it didn't meet
cost-effective standards.
After an outpouring of opposition from patients, the
$300,000 a year treatment was sent for a second review, expected to end in May.
But in Alberta, the government has offered its 15 Fabry's patients a "bridging
program" to cover their treatment until a permanent funding decision is made.
Rare disease specialist Dr. Joe Clarke at the Hospital for Sick Children says
the government's position calls into question one of the cornerstones of
Canada's health care system -- accessibility.
If you happen to be born with a rare disease,
you do not have the same access to new, groundbreaking treatments as people who
have more common diseases.
And in fact, simply by being rare, you may not be
treated at all, ever," said Dr. Clarke.
A handful of his MPS I patients in Toronto stopped their Aldurazyme treatments
when clinical trials finished.
His condition is potentially
fatal.

Rare disease kills woman: Autopsy to determine if death caused by flesh-eating
bacteria

BYLINE: JOANNE LAUCIUS; THE OTTAWA CITIZEN

SECTION: CITY; Pg.

An local woman has died of what may be flesh-eating disease.
The woman was diagnosed with invasive Group A Streptococcal disease, which
includes necrotizing fasciitis, often called "flesh-eating disease."
However, doctors are awaiting the autopsy report, expected today, before they
can confirm that the death was caused by necrotizing fasciitis or the related
toxic shock syndrome.
"At this point, I can't say if it was necrotizing fasciitis or toxic shock
syndrome.
The death, if confirmed as the fleshing-eating disease, would be the second
caused by the rare disease within a month.
There were four cases of flesh-eating disease in Ottawa-Carleton in 1997 and
only one person died of the disease, said Dr. Ellis.
There were two local cases
of toxic shock syndrome in 1997, but no deaths.
Of these patients, two died.
Although the disease is contagious and can be transmitted in bodily secretions,
cases are very rare.
The disease gets its name because it destroys the lining between muscles, called
the fascia.
Early symptoms of the disease include pain around a wound or bruise that seem
out of proportion to the injury, said Dr. Ellis.
Although flesh-eating disease can occur in clusters, as it did recently in
Virginia, there is really little cause for people who have had casual contact
with an affected person to worry, said Dr. Donald Low, chief of microbiology at
Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto.
Doctors expect to see the disease from time to time.
"Every hospital has a few
cases over a year or so," said Dr. Raphael Saginur, chief of infectious diseases
at the Ottawa Civic Hospital.
Flesh-eating disease attracts attention far out of proportion to the number of
deaths it causes.
"Often, this is a disease that affects relatively healthy individuals," said Dr.
Low.
However,
necrotizing fasciitis only officially became a reportable disease in 1995, about
the same time Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard lost a leg and nearly died from a
highly-publicized case of flesh-eating disease.
Doctors have yet to understand why some people get the disease while the vast
majority do not.
Researchers still don't know what toxins created by the bacteria are responsible
for the disease.
Dr. Low pointed out that part of the reason the disease
advances so quickly is because the patient's tissues inflame far too much, an
over-reaction to the toxins.

Arnold faces different rare diagnosis

Dec. 04--OTTUMWA -- Nearly one year ago Ashley Arnold's life changed forever.
"Last year, on Jan. 1 he was first diagnosed, so we are considering this our
first year fighting 'rare.'
We consider Ryder to be rare, and we fight something
rare every day," said Arnold while wearing a T-shirt that read "someone I love
needs a cure."
Doctors all over the Midwest have aided in the
fight to find out exactly what rare disease is causing the abnormality in the
happy infant's body.
Arnold explained that if a child suffers from a rare
disorder, it is not uncommon to have multiple diagnoses before an accurate
diagnosis can be made.
In the months following the news of Ryder's illness, the family has accepted
several diagnoses including viral, autoimmune, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Barth
syndrome and most recently Complex 1 Deficiency, a mitochondrial disease.
During the time the Arnold family believed Ryder suffered from Barth syndrome,
the proactive mom spent her days making connections with families in similar
situations.
They told me, 'You're one of us now' because even though we aren't going against
Barth, we are still fighting a mitochondrial disease."
She explained she spends much of her time caring for her
son, finding support groups that she can learn from and raising awareness for
rare diseases.
To celebrate the one-year anniversary of Ryder's fight and to raise money for
the his treatment at the Mayo Clinic, the family will be hosting an event at the
Elks Lodge beginning at 3 p.m. Jan. 10.

NPS buys back global rights to Gattex

BYLINE: by Ben Fidler

NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s dreams of becoming a global player in rare-disease
therapies came closer to fruition on Tuesday as the company reacquired worldwide
rights to two treatments, including its flagship short-bowel syndrome drug,
Gattex.
Gattex is a once-daily injection for short-bowel syndrome, which occurs when
nutrients aren't properly absorbed into the bloodstream because a part of the
small intestine is either missing or has been surgically removed (such
procedures are often the result of intestinal diseases, injuries or birth
defects).
NPS senior vice president and chief commercial officer, Eric Pauwels, said on a
conference call with analysts on Tuesday that the company has filled 72
prescriptions for Gattex so far and expects to have between 200 and 300 patients
on the drug by the end of 2013.
NPS has priced the drug at $295,000 for a year of treatment and has said that it
expects Gattex eventually to top $350 million in U.S. sales.
PTH 1-84, meanwhile, is already approved for osteoporosis in post-menopausal
women, but NPS has been testing the drug under the brand name Natpara to treat
hypoparathyroidism, a rare condition that occurs when the thyroid doesn't
produce enough parathyroid hormone and thus leaves a patient with low calcium
levels.
NPS
prioritized Gattex, as well as other orphan indications, as part of a turnaround
aimed at reinventing the company as a rare-disease powerhouse in the mold of
BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc., Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. and even Genzyme
Corp. (now owned by Sanofi).
Takeda doesn't specialize in
rare drugs, so it handed them over to NPS and structured a deal so that it can
take part in any potential upside.
But the two Lisburn women are closer than most mothers and daughters as Roma
suffers from rare inherited condition Morquio's Syndrome.
After repeated GP visits, the Draynes were referred to the Royal Hospital where
they got a rapid diagnosis of the syndrome that affects around 15 people in
Northern Ireland.
She also acknowledges support from Rare Disease UK.
"We're
supporting Rare Diseases Day on February 29."
But the
teenage girl, who loves Harry Potter and her Lord of the Rings box set, would
like better treatment from the rest of us.
We
made positive progress with our development product sarizotan, by initiating
both the potentially pivotal Sarizotan Treatment of Apneas in Rett Syndrome
(STARS) study in patients with Rett syndrome suffering from respiratory
symptoms, and the first Burden of Disease study with respect to this disease.
Post-period, we were also pleased to announce very encouraging preliminary
results from our Phase IIa study with Evenamide in patients with schizophrenia.
The launch
of Xadago in these markets means that a large and increasing number of patients
across Europe â[#x20ac]" including four of the five key EU pharmaceutical
territories â[#x20ac]" can be treated using Xadago , the first New Chemical
Entity in ten years to receive Marketing Authorization from the EU Commission
for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Once Xadago is
approved by the regulators in both of these territories, we hope that many more
patients can begin using Xadago for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
We are hopeful that Xadago will be approved in the
USA on or before its PDUFA date and that it will become available to U.S.
patients, soon.
In May, the FDA approved our Investigational New Drug (IND) application for
the evaluation of sarizotan for the treatment of patients with Rett syndrome.
This potentially
pivotal clinical study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
sarizotan in patients with Rett syndrome suffering from respiratory symptoms.
As per December 31, 2016, the study is enrolling patients in both
the USA and Europe.
We announced in June that, as part of our wider commitment to addressing the
needs of Rett syndrome patients, we are sponsoring a study to evaluate the
burden of disease experienced by patients with this debilitating condition and
their families.
In 2016, we were proud to recognise the Rare Disease Day, the World
Parkinson's Disease Awareness Day, as well as the Rett Symposium.
These global
initiatives all help to raise awareness of rare diseases and Parkinson's disease
respectively and we fully support their mission to improve the lives of both
rare disease and Parkinson's disease patients.
Evenamide met the study objectives of good tolerability,
safety, and preliminary evidence of efficacy as an add-on therapy for the
treatment of schizophrenia.
The past year has been very positive for Newron, particularly now that Xadago
is available to patients in eleven countries across Europe.
We look forward to
the result of the pending PDUFA date for Xadago and are confident that in 2017,
we will see Xadago become available to patients in the USA.
Our innovative pipeline of CNS drugs is progressing well and we look forward to
updating our shareholders on the progress as we build and strengthen our
position as a leading player in the CNS disease area.

The parents of a Newquay boy who died from a rare disease have been helping a

The parents of Joe Way, who died from Steven Johnson Syndrome (SJS) last year,
helped Pakistani boy Ali Ghazi, who has terrible eye damage due to the disease,
come to the UK for treatment.
Four-year-old Ali has Steven Johnson Syndrome (SJS) - a rare, debilitating
adverse drug reaction, which has attacked his skin and eyes, stopping him from
holding up his head because of the pain from light sensitivity.
Helen Milne, president and founder of the Milne Stevens Johnson Syndrome Society
in British Columbia, Canada, contacted Joe's parents to ask for their help after
receiving a request for help from Ali's father in Pakistan.
Working together with other parents whose children suffer from the condition,
Newquay couple Matt and Claire Way agreed to help get Ali over to the UK, where
his condition could be looked at by expert surgeons.
After several operations in August, the family decided to stay on in the UK for
the month of Ramadan, in order to start fund-raising for the next stage of
treatment.
"Unfortunately, Ali's eyes are too dry to enable stem cell treatment to be
carried out; therefore the family have returned home for a while to think about
the next stage of treatment."
"I had an e-mail from his father this week, very excited about a place at a
special school to help Ali, and continued treatment in Pakistan.
"It made us grateful that Joe lived in a country with such great medical staff,
as he had another 18 months of life for us to all enjoy"

Sun-News staffer's perplexing affliction with rare disease

BYLINE: By Alexia Severson aseverson@lcsun-news.com @AlexiaMSeverson on Twitter

LAS CRUCES &GT;&GT; While we all know about some of the most common risk factors
for cancer, such as smoking, alcohol, exposure to the sun's harmful rays,
obesity and genetics, sometimes even the most healthy people, who have no
history of cancer, can find themselves facing this deadly disease.
On April 15, Sun-News Digital Brand Manager Ryan Chip, 29, was diagnosed with
adrenocortical carcinoma, a very rare disease in which cancer forms in the outer
layer, or cortex, of an adrenal gland, located at the top of the kidneys.
Because adrenocortical carcinoma is so rare and few doctors have experience with
this form of cancer, it took doctors several days to properly diagnose Ryan, his
wife said.
Ryan was eventually sent to Houston Methodist
Hospital in Texas to see a doctor who specialized in adrenocortical carcinoma
and had worked with more than 100 patients for that particular type of cancer,
Mona Chip said.
Plans for treatment were made and Ryan had a chemo port surgically implanted on
Friday, May 15, and was later released from the hospital.
Closer look

Because adrenocortical carcinoma is so rare, less is known about this form of
cancer and few clinical studies exist to provide valuable research for treating
the disease, said Dr. William Adler, medical director and clinical research
director for the Memorial Medical Center Cancer Center.
"Sometimes (adrenocortical carcinomas) can show up sporadically and sometimes
they can be part of an inherited syndrome," Adler said.
Some examples of these hereditary diseases include Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, a rare,
inherited predisposition to multiple cancers, caused by an alteration in the p53
tumor suppressor gene; Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth disorder in
which babies are large at birth and may develop low blood sugar, and Carney
Complex, a syndrome marked by dark spots on the skin and tumors in the heart,
endocrine glands, skin, and nerves, according to the National Institutes of
Health.
"If someone has a an inherited syndrome or history of cancer, then they may want
to talk to a genetics counselor about that and ask what their risk is," Adler
said.
Unfortunately, with extremely rare cases of cancer, like in Ryan Chip's case,
it's almost impossible to be on the lookout for a cancer that effects only about
one to two people in one million per year in the U.S., he said.
"For the rare (cancers), there's not very much information," he said.
Adler said in order to continue to understand different types of cancer, and
particularly the rare ones, it's important for people who have been affected by
cancer to be open to the idea of participating clinical studies.
It's opened my eyes to really appreciate and have a lot of respect
for people living with cancer and in cancer treatment."
Before he died, Ryan Chip had wanted to get involved with CARE (Cancer Aid
Resource and Education, Inc.), a local nonprofit located at 125 N. Main St.,
Suite 114, that provides financial assistance to cancer patients in Doca Ana
County.
Help for those facing cancer

What: Cancer Aid Resource & Education Inc.

Mission: CARE is dedicated to establishing or assisting in services, resources,
general education and other additional services that help address challenges
many Doca Ana County cancer patients, children and adults, face while receiving
treatment for any type of cancer, with no cost to local cancer patients.
Ryan Chip with his grandfather George Chip Sr. Ryan Chip was diagnosed with an
extremely rare form of cancer on April 15.

Working To Corral 'Wild West' Of Drugs;; Why An Advocate For Those With Rare
Diseases Opposes Right-To-Try Legislation,

It might seem ironic that a man who has spent the past decade fighting to get
drug access for patients with rare conditions opposes right-to-try legislation.
In 2006, Andrew McFadyen attracted nationwide attention for his campaign to
access treatment for his two-year-old son, Isaac, who has the metabolic disorder
Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, known as MPS VI.
The condition is so rare only a
handful of people in Canada have it.
Among other conditions, it causes stunted growth,
skeletal changes, breathing problems, clouded corneas and heart-valve
dysfunction.
McFadyen, who lives
with his family near Campbellford, a small town between Peterborough and
Belleville, is now executive director of the Isaac Foundation, an organization
that funds research into treatments for rare diseases.
Last year, he spent
220 days on the road, often working with the families of patients with rare
diseases to get access to both unapproved and experimental drugs.
People are "incredibly naive" about the kinds of drugs and treatments that are
out there, he says.
Vulnerable patients could be at the mercy of drug companies selling potions they
know don't work, he argues.
Drug companies could charge whatever they want, and families would be on the
hook for debts caused by experimental treatments, even if the patient dies.
"I feel patients don't fully understand what could
happen."
The draft includes proposed measures to
imprison or fine "any provider of a potential life-saving treatment who
knowingly fails to comply

with this act or the regulations."
It's hard for patients to provide true informed consent, he says.
McFadyen admits the two sides of the argument have similar goals - to get
lifechanging drugs and treatments to people who desperately need them.
But these
systems are in place to protect patients and industry."
He says he hopes in the next few years his son will be able to take advantage of
a gene therapy treatment in development.
McFadyen says his family may seek access during Phase 3 of the clinical trial,
after the treatment's safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.

TJ Willis has lost his battle with Menkes syndrome, but his mom said she knows
her young son will make a difference in the world.
Six-month-old TJ died Christmas Eve from the rare, terminal genetic disease he
was diagnosed with when he was 16 weeks old.
Menkes is a copper transport syndrome, Willis said, and copper is needed for
proper brain development.
Willis noted
while Menkes is typically passed from mother to child, a genetic test confirmed
she was not a carrier of the syndrome.
According to the Menkes Foundation, the disease prohibits the intestines from
absorbing copper.
"They're rarely diagnosed in the first few months of life unless there's a
genetic link," he said.
Angle said most children with the disease die within the first few years of
life, though some uncommon, milder cases can result in children living into
their teens.
"It's pretty rare, but not rare enough that people are never going to see this,"
she said.
"It's a terminal disease, but there is a (copper) treatment if they
are treated within the first 10 days of life.
It's critical that people learn
about this so kids can get treatment in time."
"TJ's diagnosis of Menkes syndrome is devastating, but Darcy is
taking a difficult situation and trying to make it positive.
She is raising
awareness to this disease with the hope that it can help another family or
doctor diagnose the illness sooner."

KOLKATA: Afflicted with a rare disease that requires a fortune to treat, the
parents of a 10-year-old boy in Shibpur, Howrah, are groping in the dark even as
their son gradually slips into an abyss.
Arian Chowdhury is suffering from the Hunter syndrome, a genetic disease caused
by mutation that leads to deposition of biomolecules in cells.
One in 2,00,000
suffers from the disease.
Except in developed nations, most patients die young
with parents unable to afford the lifelong treatment of Rs 1 crore a year.
The only way to arrest his condition is
by injecting a critical enzyme that is deficient in his body," said child
specialist and Institute of Child Health director Apurba Ghosh.
Enzyme replacement therapy is now available for the syndrome.
But the vials are
too expensive for any individual to afford the treatment that costs around Rs 2
lakh a week.
"It feels so helpless to see Arian's condition deteriorate, more so knowing
there is a treatment available.
While he has become stoic after learning about their son's disease in 2006, his
wife Debjani is unable to come to terms with their son's short life and
prolonged death.
Though
they can conceive another child and get a pre-natal test done to ensure it does
not suffer from the disease, neither parent is willing to think beyond Arian.
As soon as Ghosh saw Arian he knew he again had the dreaded syndrome case in his
hands.
There, a 24-hour urine test confirmed the syndrome.
The news that a treatment is available brought joy but was short-lived when they
learnt how prohibitive the cost was.
"There are two types of views about rare
diseases: one is that patients should be treated as individuals and not
commodities; the other is that given the multiple problems in India, the state
cannot spare scarce resources on individuals.

Barely 6, he deserves to live a happy, long life - Kid in capital battles rare

When the world observes MPS Awareness Day on Monday, a Ranchi couple will keep
their fingers crossed for a windfall to save their only son who suffers from the
rare metabolic disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis or MPS.
Five-and-a-half-year-old Shaurya has been enduring MPS-II or Hunter Syndrome -
an inherited condition caused by a deficient or absent enzyme - for the past
three years.
Treatment for Hunter Syndrome that has an average life expectancy of 10 years
comes at a premium.
His rare condition was, subsequently, confirmed
by AIIMS in Delhi.
We sought
audience with the Union health minister every time we were in Delhi for
Shaurya's treatment.
Acting on a reference letter from Ranchi MP Ram Tahal Chowdhury, the PMO
sanctioned Rs 3 lakh this March to be transferred to AIIMS for Shaurya's
treatment.
"The hospital has given us an estimate of Rs 1.86 crore for our son's year-long
treatment and Rs 3 lakh may be the cost of just one vial of enzyme.
Shaurya
needs 104 such vials in a year," Saurav said, adding that the aid from the PMO
would lapse in three months if they couldn't arrange the rest of the amount and
begin treatment.
Call it ignorance or apathy, the Jharkhand government doesn't include Hunter
Syndrome in its list of rare diseases that are covered under beneficiary
schemes.
According to the father, pharmaceutical giant Shire that manufactures Hunter
Syndrome medicines in the US had not very long ago announced a charitable
programme, offering free vials to MPS-II patients.
As uncertainty looms over his treatment, Shaurya - the only reported case of
MPS-II in Jharkhand till date - continues to suffer.
Given that the majority of congenital anomalies have an occurrence of just five
out of 10,000 live births, many are classified as rare diseases.
That number may
seem small, but it translates into approximately 246,000 people with rare
diseases throughout the EU s 27 member countries.
So while the families of children with rare diseases navigate a lonely course,
it might bring some comfort to know that data that can help them is in fact all
collated and analysed in Belfast.
When it comes to Down syndrome, Prof Dolk said rates in Europe had gone up
because of increasing maternal age.
Ireland itself sticks out a little in not having terminations of pregnancy
there would be many more children born in Ireland with Down syndrome for example
than in many other European countries.
Prof Dolk said that data showed there had been a small decrease in rates of
congenital heart disease, although Eurocat is not yet quite sure why, but rates
of gastroschisis, an intestinal defect in babies, are on the way up.
Eurocat is just a part of what the EU is doing to tackle rare diseases and
Ireland, along with all member states, has been tasked with developing a
national strategy for rare diseases by 2013.
The Irish Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation (GRDO) will be working with
patient groups here to ensure the Department of Health s plan will include fair
and equitable access to treatments for everyone with a rare disease.
Rare Disease Day is tomorrow.

Pennsylvania State Legislature Memoranda: Creation of Rare Disease Advisory
Council (previously HB 2402)

LENGTH: 250  words

DATELINE: New York



 Harrisburg: Pennsylvania State Legislature has issued the following Memoranda
updates:



 In the near future, I plan to reintroduce legislation (previously HB 2402) to
establish a Rare Disease Advisory Council within the Pennsylvania Department of
Health.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), one in 10 Americans live
with a rare disease.
Rare diseases and disorders are those which affect small
patient populations, typically populations smaller than 200,000 individuals in
the United States.
Such diseases and conditions include Huntington's disease,
Lou Gehrig's disease, Tourette syndrome, Chron's disease and Cystic Fibrosis,
among others.
Of the nearly 7,000 rare diseases identified by the NIH, only
about 200 rare diseases have Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments.
The establishment of a Rare Disease Advisory Council will create a unique
collaborative partnership between patients, providers, researchers, agencies and
insurers in an effort to improve the lives of those living with one of the 7,000
devastating rare diseases.
The Council's focus will be on the needs of the rare
disease community and the actions necessary to address those needs.
This legislation is a top priority for the Rare Disease Caucus and is supported
by the National Organization for Rare Disorders.

A couple who were suspected of shaking their baby have been reunited with their
child after it emerged she has a rare medical condition which causes "easy
bruising".
But social workers dropped the case against the parents after hearing medical
evidence that Effie suffers from a rare disease called EDS IV.
This is the first time a court has considered a child with the condition at a
fact finding hearing.
Effie Stillwell, who was born in spring 2016, is now set to return to live with
her parents, and unusually the judge has given permission for the family to be
named in the hope of developing knowledge about the EDS IV Syndrome.
During the hearing Miss Andrew was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos syndrome, and
tests showed that her daughter also had a form of the condition, making her skin
bruise easily, and her blood vessels and organs at risk of rupturing.
The judge said that EDS was an unpredictable and unique disease, and cited the
example of a 13-year-old girl with EDS who died when her uterus ruptured during
her first period.

BELLUS Health Provides Update on Pipeline

LENGTH: 835  words


Dec. 21 -- BELLUS Health Inc. (TSX: BLU) (BELLUS Health or the Company), a drug
development company focused on rare diseases, is providing an update on the
projects in its pipeline.
Highlights

* Auven Therapeutics, BELLUS Health's partner who acquired the rights to KIACTA
from the Company in 2010, has decided to terminate the KIACTA program for the
treatment of AA amyloidosis;

* Auven Therapeutics is evaluating the conduct of a Phase 2/3 study with KIACTA
in sarcoidosis, a rare and sometimes lethal lung disease;

* BELLUS Health has received positive regulatory feedback from the FDA in
regards to the design of a Phase 2 study for Shigamab in STEC related Hemolytic
Uremic Syndrome (sHUS);

* Update on partnered drug candidates, including AMO-01 for the treatment of
Fragile X Syndrome and ALZ-801 for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease in APOE4
Homozygous patients.
"While the termination of the KIACTA AA amyloidosis program is not unexpected
considering the negative Phase III study results released in June, we are still
disappointed for the patients suffering from AA amyloidosis and their families,"
said Roberto Bellini, President and Chief Executive Officer of BELLUS Health.
KIACTA for AA Amyloidosis

Top-line results from the KIACTA Phase 3 study for the treatment of AA
amyloidosis were announced on June 20, 2016.
As a result of
the negative outcome of the Phase 3 clinical trial, Auven Therapeutics has
decided to terminate the KIACTA program for the treatment of AA amyloidosis.
KIACTA for Sarcoidosis

Auven Therapeutics is currently evaluating the potential use of KIACTA for the
treatment of patients suffering from active pulmonary sarcoidosis.
Sarcoidosis is a rare condition that causes patches of red and swollen tissue -
called granulomas - that can develop in multiple organs in the body, but mostly
in the lungs and skin.
There is no cure for chronic sarcoidosis, and treatment
options are limited and can have serious adverse effects.
Shigamab for sHUS

BELLUS Health has received positive regulatory feedback from the FDA in relation
to the clinical Phase 2 study protocol for the assessment of the efficacy and
safety of Shigamab in the treatment of children suffering from sHUS.
sHUS is a rare disease which principally affects the kidneys and often leads to
acute dialysis, and in certain cases chronic kidney disease and death, primarily
in children.
AMO-01 for Fragile X Syndrome

AMO Pharma Limited, the Company's licensee of AMO-01 for the treatment of
neurologic and psychiatric disorders, is expected to initiate a Phase 2 study on
patients with Fragile X Syndrome in the first half of 2017.
Fragile X Syndrome is the most common inherited cause of autism and intellectual
disabilities, affecting approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females.
There are currently no approved
drugs indicated for the treatment of Fragile X Syndrome.
ALZ-801 for APOE4 Homozygous Alzheimer's Disease

ALZ-801 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), initially developed by
BELLUS Health and licensed to Alzheon Inc. (Alzheon) in 2013, is a prodrug of
tramiprosate, a beta-amyloid targeting small molecule shown to improve cognition
and function in AD patients who are carriers of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) AD
genotype, and to reduce soluble beta-amyloid in the cerebral spinal fluid of AD
patients.
Recent third-party positive clinical results for the treatment of early AD using
anti-beta-amyloid antibodies lend further support to the concept of amyloid beta
clearance as a promising approach for the treatment of AD.
Alzheon has completed two bridging Phase 1b clinical studies with ALZ-801 and is
currently in preparation for a pivotal Phase 2/3 program focusing on treatment
of mild AD patients who are homozygous for APOE4, the most important genetic
risk factor for late-onset AD.

ArmaGen Technologies Raises US$17 Million In Series A Financing

   11/29/2012 12:00:00 AM

   ArmaGen Technologies, Inc. (formerly Neurogenic Technologies, Inc.), a
biotechnology company, raised $17m in series A financing round.
This financing allows ArmaGen Technologies to expand its existing operations,
and continue the clinical development of biopharmaceuticals targeting diseases
of the central nervous system (CNS), which are engineered to penetrate the
blood-brain barrier (BBB).
Stu Swiedler, said, "I believe that ArmaGen has an ideal technology to help
develop brain-penetrating recombinant proteins for the treatment of a broad
range of rare diseases that affect the brain but also the periphery.
If this
works, doctors will have the potential to treat their patients with only one
drug.
This would be really a breakthrough for their patients.
Martin Heidecker of Boehringer, said, I am very excited to work with such an
experienced team on orphan diseases, but what makes me really excited about the
technology is the potential of broad application in neurodegenerative and other
indications that affect the brain.

FONTANA - Patrick Abram Jr.'s recovery from a rare and potentially deadly
disease culminated in a primetime TV appearance.
Abram, who was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome in April 2010, was featured
recently on an episode of "Monsters Inside Me" on the Animal Planet Network.
Eighteen of the patients died.
There have been fewer than 200 cases of Lemierre's syndrome documented in the
United States in the past 50 years, according to one source.
The elder Abram said they agreed to do the TV show in order to spread the word
about the rare disease.
Abram was diagnosed with Lemierre's disease, which
scatters clusters of bacteria through the body and brain.

Things You Should Know About Kawasaki Syndrome

LENGTH: 195 words

DATELINE: U.S.


U.S., May 18 -- Kawasaki Syndrome affects children by harming coronary arteries
and targeting blood vessels.
The rare disease mostly affects children aged
between 1 and 5.
Kawasaki disease is an autoimmune disease in which the medium-sized blood
vessels throughout the body become inflamed.
As per the experts, parents should visit a doctor as soon as they see any
symptom of the Kawasaki Syndrome.
The symptoms of the disease are fever for four
or more days, swollen lymph nodes, body rashes, peeling of skin from hands,
redness in eyes, cracked lips, cracked tongue and swollen limbs.
Experts from Max Super Speciality Hospitals said that the symptoms of Kawasaki
Syndrome are the same as signs of viral infection.
The expert further added that the syndrome should be detected within seven days
as after this period is over, treatment becomes very tough.

Leeds mum's fears over future of son's pioneering treatment

LENGTH: 533  words


A mum has spoken of her fears over a new drug funding rule which could leave her
son without access to the pioneering treatment she spent two years fighting for
him to receive.
Katy Brown, from Otley, tirelessly campaigned for her son, Sam, now eight - who
has life-limiting Morquio Syndrome - to receive Vimizim, a drug which health
regulator NICE finally agreed to fund in 2015 for five years.
Due to the inherent high cost of drugs for ultra-rare diseases, Mrs Brown, from
Otley, said this decision "directly discriminates" against patients such as her
son and branded it a "mis-guided, cost cutting exercise that will permanently
damage lives".
The new rules involve the introduction of a £300,000 quality-adjusted life year
(QALY) threshold for medicines evaluated through NICE's Highly Specialised
Technologies (HST) programme for very rare conditions.
QALYs are a generic measurement of disease burden which NICE use to gauge drug
effectiveness in terms of how much it would cost to give a year of healthy life.
Campaigners say many treatments for ultra-rare conditions currently funded by
NHS England have costs per QALY of well over £300,000 - including Vimizim.
Morquio Syndrome is a degenerative condition which limits growth and mobility
and shortens life expectancy to an average of 25 years.
There is no known cure
but patients say Vimizim - an enzyme replacement therapy - improves lives by
allowing children to grow, as well as improve stamina, the ability to walk and
pain levels.
In a letter to NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon, Mrs Brown
described the new rules as "like a cruel and depressing version of Groundhog
Day", writing: "Your consultation singles out people with the protected
characteristic of disability, and directly stops their access to new treatments
for no other reason than the condition that they were unfortunate enough to be
born with is ultra rare."
The MPS Society, which represents Morquio patients and others with rare
inherited metabolic dieases, said the decision means the children and young
adults "will be condemned to death".
Chairman Paul Moody said it confirms that "children and young adults with ultra-
rare diseases going forward are economic pawns in a failing NHS and cheaper dead
than alive".
A NICE spokesperson said: "Drugs for very rare diseases will be evaluated
against a sliding scale, so the more additional QALYs a medicine offers - that
is, the more therapeutic benefit a drug offers a patient when compared to
current standard treatment - the more generous the cost per QALY level it will
need to meet, starting at £100,000 per QALY, rising to a maximum of £300,000 per
QALY.

Leeds mum's fears over future of son's pioneering treatment

LENGTH: 533  words


A mum has spoken of her fears over a new drug funding rule which could leave her
son without access to the pioneering treatment she spent two years fighting for
him to receive.
Katy Brown, from Otley, tirelessly campaigned for her son, Sam, now eight - who
has life-limiting Morquio Syndrome - to receive Vimizim, a drug which health
regulator NICE finally agreed to fund in 2015 for five years.
Due to the inherent high cost of drugs for ultra-rare diseases, Mrs Brown, from
Otley, said this decision "directly discriminates" against patients such as her
son and branded it a "mis-guided, cost cutting exercise that will permanently
damage lives".
The new rules involve the introduction of a £300,000 quality-adjusted life year
(QALY) threshold for medicines evaluated through NICE's Highly Specialised
Technologies (HST) programme for very rare conditions.
QALYs are a generic measurement of disease burden which NICE use to gauge drug
effectiveness in terms of how much it would cost to give a year of healthy life.
Campaigners say many treatments for ultra-rare conditions currently funded by
NHS England have costs per QALY of well over £300,000 - including Vimizim.
Morquio Syndrome is a degenerative condition which limits growth and mobility
and shortens life expectancy to an average of 25 years.
There is no known cure
but patients say Vimizim - an enzyme replacement therapy - improves lives by
allowing children to grow, as well as improve stamina, the ability to walk and
pain levels.
In a letter to NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon, Mrs Brown
described the new rules as "like a cruel and depressing version of Groundhog
Day", writing: "Your consultation singles out people with the protected
characteristic of disability, and directly stops their access to new treatments
for no other reason than the condition that they were unfortunate enough to be
born with is ultra rare."
The MPS Society, which represents Morquio patients and others with rare
inherited metabolic dieases, said the decision means the children and young
adults "will be condemned to death".
Chairman Paul Moody said it confirms that "children and young adults with ultra-
rare diseases going forward are economic pawns in a failing NHS and cheaper dead
than alive".
A NICE spokesperson said: "Drugs for very rare diseases will be evaluated
against a sliding scale, so the more additional QALYs a medicine offers - that
is, the more therapeutic benefit a drug offers a patient when compared to
current standard treatment - the more generous the cost per QALY level it will
need to meet, starting at £100,000 per QALY, rising to a maximum of £300,000 per
QALY.

Memorandum: Creation of Rare Disease Advisory Council (previously HB 2402)

LENGTH: 275  words

DATELINE: New York



 Harrisburg: Pennsylvania House of Representatives has issued the following
Memorandum:



  From:     Representative Marcy Toepel

 To:     All House members

 Subject:     Creation of Rare Disease Advisory Council (previously HB 2402)





 In the near future, I plan to reintroduce legislation (previously HB 2402) to
establish a Rare Disease Advisory Council within the Pennsylvania Department of
Health.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), one in 10 Americans live
with a rare disease.
Rare diseases and disorders are those which affect small
patient populations, typically populations smaller than 200,000 individuals in
the United States.
Such diseases and conditions include Huntington's disease,
Lou Gehrig's disease, Tourette syndrome, Chron's disease and Cystic Fibrosis,
among others.
Of the nearly 7,000 rare diseases identified by the NIH, only
about 200 rare diseases have Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments.
The establishment of a Rare Disease Advisory Council will create a unique
collaborative partnership between patients, providers, researchers, agencies and
insurers in an effort to improve the lives of those living with one of the 7,000
devastating rare diseases.
The Council's focus will be on the needs of the rare
disease community and the actions necessary to address those needs.
This legislation is a top priority for the Rare Disease Caucus and is supported
by the National Organization for Rare Disorders.

Building a Company to Treat a Rare Disease

Karen Aiach was working as a management consultant when she learned that her
first daughter, Ornella, had Sanfilippo syndrome, a rare disease in which a
missing enzyme causes toxic substances to build up in the body.
Within two years of the diagnosis, Ms. Aiach, who lives in a Paris suburb, had
quit her consulting job to learn everything she could about the disease.
And when
she learned that few treatments were in the works, she founded a company called
Lysogene  to focus on genetic therapy.
Instead of raising money and awareness by setting up a nonprofit foundation, a
more typical route, she opted to start a for-profit company to seek treatments,
if not a cure.
Far from common, what Ms. Aiach and other parents like her are
trying is to leverage their wealth, contacts and the hope of sophisticated
investors to jump-start research into rare diseases.
''My goal was to find a therapeutic approach to that disease,'' she said.
And even with their abundance of
dedication, many parents start with little knowledge of the science behind the
causes of the diseases that plague their children.
But with some rare diseases, where minimal research has been done, a little
effort goes a long way.
Nicole Boice, who founded Global Genes, one of the leading rare-disease patient
advocacy organizations, said even small investments can have meaningful impacts.
''A lot of people in science dismiss that because cures are rare.
In 1998, John Crowley left
his job at Bristol-Myers Squibb to start a biotechnology company to search for a
treatment for Pompe disease, a neuromuscular disorder that two of his children
had.
Within four years, the company, Novazyme Pharmaceuticals, had devised a
treatment that he credits with saving their lives.
The prognosis for people who have the
disease, considered a severe form of muscular dystrophy, is to need to use a
wheelchair by the time they are teenagers.
''The hope is always that we'll be able to become a center of gravity for this
one disease,'' he said.
''The company will be focused on many diseases.''
Ms. Boice of Global Genes said such persistence and determination could attack
some of the 7,000 known rare diseases that affect about 350 million people
worldwide.
Only 30 percent of the diseases have any coordinated effort to raise
money or encourage research, she said, and 500 of them have treatments.
There are a lot more companies willing to work on rare diseases than there were
two decades ago.
Mr. Ganot, who said his company would start trials in 2017, acknowledged that
various factors would determine if the treatment was successful.
And even small breakthroughs can buy patients time.
Ornella Aiach's disease had
become quite advanced by the time she turned 6 and she became the first patient
to receive the gene replacement treatment that Lysogene had developed.
After financing the research for years from their savings and contributions from
friends, Ms. Aiach recently raised $18.6 million from outside investors and
hopes the money will allow her to broaden the trials on the treatment her
daughter receives and make more progress.
Ms. Aiach realizes a cure for her daughter may not be possible, but the
treatment could offer far greater hope for others who are treated earlier in the
progression of the disease.
The gene therapy may also have applications for
people with Parkinson's disease.
The treatment has, in effect, slowed the ravages of Sanfilippo syndrome.
''Doctors had told us that it would take 15 or 20 years to develop a treatment,
and it would be too late,'' Ms. Aiach said.
''The way drugs and treatments are
developed now is changing a lot.

Inmate gives voice to little-known disease

   PENETANGUISHENE - From his cell-like room in Ontario's only maximum-security
hospital, a 24-year-old North York native spins a web across the country, trying
to raise interest in a rare disease he believes has damaged his life.
Toronto and North York city councils have declared this week Klinefelter's
Syndrome Awareness Week.
David Rabinovitch suffers from Klinefelter's syndrome, a doctor at Oak Ridge
said.
He has been under the care of a Wellesley Hospital specialist, who is also
on the board of directors of the Klinefelter's syndrome group.
Rabinovitch blames the syndrome for his arsons.
He says the disease, a genetic
mutation that gives its sufferers at least one extra female chromosome, was the
cause of the bizarre behavior that put him in the prison-like hospital with 130
other inmates who are considered dangerous.
He then learned he was suffering from the rare disease that may have contributed
to his strange behavior.
A publication by three U.S. experts
called Klinefelter's Syndrome: The X-tra Special Boy, cites concern by the
medical community over the number of Klinefelter's sufferers who are in jails
and mental institutions.
Marvin Miller and
Stephen Sulks, described what they believe to be a correlation between the
syndrome and fire-setting.
Their research found 19 per cent of their patients
were arsonists, but fire-setting declined in half of the arsonists after they
received the male hormone testosterone.
Rabinovitch says he may never have lit fires if he hadn't suffered from the
disorder, but by the time he knew he had Klinefelter's syndrome his life was in
chaos.
He believes he is an innocent victim of the disease, which according to medical
research papers affects one in 1,000 men.
It is much rarer in women yet there
are five organizations in Canada for females who have the disease.
Dan Parle, a spokesperson for the hospital, says management has offered to pick
up the organization's mail from another post box but it shies away from
endorsing any group, including those founded by patients.
But in Oak Ridge, there will be no party for Rabinovitch - just another week of
sending out mail to doctors, lawyers and the media about a disease few people
know anything about.arson; mental; health; David; Rabinovitch; biography

Aldeyra Therapeutics to Present Novel Data on Potential Treatment for
Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome at 2015 Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders
Annual Meeting

LENGTH: 414  words


Jan. 29 -- US-based Aldeyra Therapeutics issued the following news release:

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALDX) (Aldeyra), a biotechnology company
focused on the development of products to treat diseases related to free
aldehydes, today announced that novel data on the potential of its lead product
candidate, NS2, to treat Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) has been accepted for a
poster presentation at the upcoming 2015 Society for Inherited Metabolic
Disorders (SIMD) Annual Meeting, being held March 28-31, 2015 in Salt Lake City,
Utah.
SLS is a rare disease caused by mutations in an aldehyde-metabolizing enzyme,
fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase.
In SLS, aldehyde-mediated modification of lipids
(fats) is thought to disrupt the dermal moisture barrier, leading to the severe
ichthyosis (dry, scaly, thickened skin) that is characteristic of the disease.

forward to presenting this data that suggest the potential of NS2 to ameliorate
the debilitating symptoms of SLS, a rare but serious life-long condition.
NS2 is an aldehyde-binding small molecule based on an innovative platform
technology focused on trapping free aldehydes, which are toxic and
pro-inflammatory mediators of numerous diseases.
As a product candidate, NS2 is
currently being evaluated to address two underserved rare diseases, SLS and
noninfectious anterior uveitis.

REACHING INTO CYBERSPACE FOR SUPPORT IN ILLNESSES

Patients and their families bond and learn on the Internet

The Smyth family, from left, Willy, 7, David, 9, dad Mike and mom
 Kim, stays in touch with other families who have a child, like
 David, with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.
Psychiatrist Arlette Lefebvre uses everything at hand, including
 the Internet, to work with patients.
They came together because of Shwachman-

Diamond syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the pancreas' ability to
digest food and results in poor bone marrow function.
About 20 per cent of children with SDS die, usually
from serious infections or a rare form of leukemia that doesn't respond well to
chemotherapy.
There are 12 SDS families across the country, eight of them in the Toronto area,
who have communicated with each other via the Smyth's Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome
Canada organization Web site.
After years of feeling
isolated by this rare disorder and craving emotional support, the Smyths decided
to use the Internet to reach out to other SDS families.
''I was getting really tired of constantly having to tell my story to doctors
and medical professionals who weren't familiar with the syndrome,'' explains Kim
Smyth.
They entered ''Shwachman syndrome'' into an Internet search engine and located
the International Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome site in St. Louis, Mo., (www.shwach

man-diamond.org).
They've since registered their fundraising charity, Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome
Canada, which supports community awareness and research, including the Sick
Kids' SDS research team.
''The most important thing with a rare disorder is to establish a huge database.
Since 1992, the charitable organization that she co-founded, Ability Online
Support Network (www.able

link.org), has electronically linked children with chronic diseases or
disabilities to both disabled and non-disabled peers and mentors.
Ayala, 12, is a patient of

Lefebvre's who started her own Web page last May (www.ordesign.com/nopainzone)
to help her connect with others suffering from the same painful condition,
called reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
''Not only people who have RSD, but also others with conditions or diseases that
are often painful, such as arthritis and fibromyalgia,'' she explains.
Not all doctors encourage their patients to use the Web and that's a shame, says
Levebvre, author of the new book Taking Your Kids Online: How And When To
Introduce Children To The Internet (co-written with Brian Hillis, $21.99, McGraw
Hill-Ryerson).
Physicians and patients need to work together to find the answers
to a patient's questions, she says, and often those can be explored online.
Information on rare diseases
and disorders is available from the National Organization for Rare Disorders
(NORD) at www.rare

diseases.org and its Canadian equivalent CORD site at www.bulli.com/cord ''are
the mecca of rare diseases,'' she says.
Lefebvre's own Web site www.froggie.org includes 42 health care links, mostly in
Canada and the U.S. (Canadian sites are flagged), as well as information on such
diseases as diabetes, anorexia nervosa and cystic fibrosis, in addition to kids'
and parents' links.
Long, an RN with a master's degree in health science, used the Internet to find
information and links to a rare genetic malformation of the brain stem called
Arnold Chiari malformation and basilar impression.
Her queries about her condition
posted on the Internet led her to a leading neurosurgeon in Spain.
That is quite a
large number for such a rare disorder,'' she says.

A 10-year-old New Brunswick boy suffering from a rare and often fatal disease
will receive an expensive treatment for his illness for one year, the province's
health minister announced, reversing a decision the government made earlier this
year.
Victor Boudreau issued a brief statement Wednesday saying the province will pay
for up to 12 months worth of Vimizim to assess its effectiveness in treating
Morgan Doucet, who has Morquio syndrome.
She said Morgan is in declining health because the disease causes an enzyme
deficiency that leads to many complications.
However, the statement said New Brunswick will work with other provinces to
devise a national approach to reviewing expensive drugs for rare diseases.
Last month, the Saskatchewan government said it would pay for one year of
Vimizim treatments for three siblings who have Morquio syndrome.
The drug is not a cure, though studies indicate it is effective in slowing down
the disease.

CHILDREN born by IVF are about five times more likely to develop a rare genetic
growth disorder, an Australian study has found.
The study was based on 37 babies diagnosed with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, a
rare disease that causes babies to overgrow.
The study found the syndrome
affected one in 400 children born through IVF.
The general prevalence of the syndrome ranges from one in 35,000 to one in

Kabuki Syndrome, which occurs once in every 32,000 births worldwide, can affect
the major organs and children diagnosed with it often have intellectual
disabilities.

At least 12 cases of Kawasaki syndrome, a rare disease in young children that
inflames the body's blood vessels, have been reported from city hospitals in the
last six months.
Doctors however are alarmed by a few cases where children
affected by the seemingly noncontagious disease were living in the same
locality.
The disease
that usually occurs in children between ages of one and five can lead to serious
cardiac complications, including heart attack.
While this was her first Kawasaki
diagnosis, a registry of the disease in Mumbai has about 160 confirmed cases.
The recent uncommon occurrence, he said, was a case where the condition has
recurred in a child.
"Recurrence is very rare as the disease is known to afflict
just once in a lifetime," he said.
"The cause is often a mix of genetic,
environmental and immunological reasons," he said, adding that the treatment
cost remains a big challenge.
It could range from a few thousands to a lakh The
syndrome was first described by Tomisaku Kawasaki in Japan in 1967.

New Pfizer research unit to focus on rare diseases

BYLINE: Lee Howard, The Day, New London, Conn.
20--Research on rare diseases used to be the province of start-up biotech
firms, but with blockbuster drugs harder and harder to find, even the world's
largest pharmaceutical firm can't pass up small opportunities.
That's why Pfizer Inc. has announced the formation of a new research unit, based
in Cambridge, Mass., which will focus exclusively on diseases affecting fewer
than 200,000 people.
The National Organization for Rare Disorders, known as NORD, lists more than
1,000 rare diseases, ranging from bubonic plague to sudden infant death syndrome
to West Nile encephalitis, otherwise known as eastern equine encephalitis.
But
Pfizer said more than 6,000 diseases have been classified as "orphan diseases,"
and less than 10 percent of these have available therapies targeting underlying
causes.
"NORD is very happy that Pfizer is establishing a Rare Diseases Research Unit,"
Peter L. Saltonstall, president and chief executive of the organization, said in
a statement.
"Approximately 30 million Americans ... have rare diseases and, for
most of those people, there is no specific treatment."
"We are coupling Pfizer's existing experience in rare diseases, such as
hemophilia, with our advanced protein technologies, resources and world-class
scientific team to focus on becoming a driving force in rare disease research,"
Gutierrez-Ramos said in a statement.
New York-based Pfizer said its new unit "will pursue treatments across all
therapeutic areas and modalities" and called the move "a further step in
Pfizer's strategy to apply our strong science and technology base to find
innovative new treatments for patients."
Pfizer told The Boston Globe that
hemophilia, muscular dystrophy and serious diseases spurred by mutating genes
will be initial areas of concentration.
Pfizer would not specify how many people would be involved in the rare-disease
unit nor how it would interact with the scientists at Pfizer's campuses in
Groton and New London who study a wide range of diseases.
Pfizer told The Globe that the rare-disease unit would be looking to partner
with universities and biotech firms in the Boston area to advance new research.
Though rare diseases don't offer the potential large markets that drugs
targeting major disorders can tap into, the barriers for getting therapies
approved are lower, which reduces the costs associated with developing
medicines.
So-called orphan drugs -- therapies that treat diseases in which no
remedy is currently available -- receive favorable treatment from the FDA,
accelerating the speed at which companies can bring products to market.
Pfizer signaled its interest in rare diseases late last year, when it bought the
rights to an experimental drug to fight Gaucher's disease, an enzyme deficiency
that can damage the liver and bone marrow, occasionally leading to death.
At the time of the Protalix agreement, Kindler said focusing on rare diseases
fit in with Pfizer's strategy of looking for new therapies to treat unmet
medical needs.
Pfizer's move into rare diseases coincides with a similar strategy from British
drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, announced in February.
GSK estimates that 6 to 8 percent of the population worldwide may be affected by
a rare disease.

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: US Food and Drug Administration, The Government of USA has issued
the following news release:



 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved three new indications for
Ilaris (canakinumab).
The new indications are for rare and serious
auto-inflammatory diseases in adult and pediatric patients:





     Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS);

     Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)/Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD);
and

     Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).
All three syndromes are hereditary diseases that are characterized by periodic
attacks of fever and inflammation, as well as severe muscle pain.
"For the first time, patients with TRAPS and HIDS/MKD, two painful and life
altering diseases, have access to a treatment that may help improve their
quality of life," said Badrul Chowdhury, M.D., Ph.D, director of the Division of
Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research.
Ilaris was previously approved for another periodic fever syndrome called
Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) and for active systemic juvenile
idiopathic arthritis.

Health services let Sam suffer;
GREG MULHOLLAND, Liberal Democrat MP for Leeds North West, reveals how a
six-year-old boy is being failed by the system

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg.
When he was just 16 months old his parents Katy and
Simon received the kind of news any parent would dread: Sam had a rare disease
known as Morquio syndrome.
So rare in fact that only 87 other people in the UK
have it.
There is no cure for Morquio syndrome.
It is a degenerative condition that
causes irreversible damage but a drug called Vimizim, approved at European level
and used in 20 other European countries, but not the UK, can halt the worsening
of the condition.
It
was a nurse saying there might be a drug that could help Sam cope with his
condition but this drug was only being trialled in the UK.
In
December, after the threat of legal action that the scorecard was discriminatory
towards those with rare diseases, NHS England accepted this and suspended use of
the scorecard.
It then did not
bother responding to a drugs company willing to supply treatment at a cheaper
price.
The single mum has four children and two of her sons, Michael, 16, and Thomas,
11, have multiple disabilities including epilepsy and Christian Syndrome.
The syndrome is a rare disease which causes the malformation of the skull, limbs
and palate.
"On a bad day Michael will spend the entire time sleeping and when
he is awake he will be dry retching or gagging, that's part of the syndrome he
lives with," Ms Goldfinch says.

Walk for rare diseases sees huge participation

DATELINE: Bengaluru


Bengaluru, Feb. 29 -- Around 2,500 Bengalureans turned up to show their support
for rare diseases at 'Race for 7', a 7-km walk organised here on Sunday to raise
awareness on the issue.
More than 50 participants with rare diseases joined the rally, including
15-year-old Nihal Bitla, who suffers from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome,
which was depicted in Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Paa.
We expected a team of 7,000 people to raise awareness on the 7,000
rare diseases," said founder-director of the Organisation For Rare Diseases
India (ORDI) Prasanna Kumar B. Shirol whose daughter suffers from Pompe disease.
Sanofi Genzyme is developing Leukine for the treatment of acute radiation
syndrome.
Acute radiation syndrome is a serious illness that occurs in people
exposed to high doses of radiation.
The condition involves injuries to the
body's organs, including the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs, and
can cause neutropenia, an abnormally low level of white blood cells that fight
infection called neutrophils.
"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the cause of death
in most cases of acute radiation syndrome is the destruction of the person's
bone marrow[1]," said Richard Peters, Sanofi Genzyme's Global Head of Rare
Diseases.
Since then Sanofi Genzyme has conducted studies
regarding the potential use of Leukine in patients acutely exposed to
myelosuppressive doses of radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation
Syndrome).

One in a million;
Neglected by governments and drug companies, patients with rare genetic diseases
face a life of pain and suffering, writes Elaine Yau

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg.
Wing-kei, affectionately known as Kei Kei, is one of seven people in Hong Kong
who suffer from Pompe disease, a rare disorder that disables the muscles
including those of the heart.
The medicine costs more than
HK$90,000 per month, and the Hospital Authority had been subsidising the
treatment since 2008.
"Without the medicine, her condition will keep worsening until she dies," says
Man, a clerical worker, who has since launched fundraising campaigns to help pay
the medical bills.
"However, with continuous treatment, she can have a normal
lifespan."
Thousands of people suffer from rare diseases in Hong Kong.
While there are no
official numbers, Stephen Lam Tak-sum,  president of the International
Federation of Human Genetics Societies,  says several hundred rare diseases have
been recorded in local medical literature.
Countries vary in how they define rare disease.
In the US it's a disease  that
affects fewer than 200,000 people; in Europe it's one that affects less than 1
in 2,000 people.
In Hong Kong, Lam says in general, a rare disease  has an
incidence rate of less than 1 in 10,000.
"While local medical school involves teachings on such diseases, many doctors
have never seen even a single case in their lifetime, rendering diagnosis for
patients difficult," he says.
With tomorrow being Rare Disease Day, paediatricians and  patient support groups
worldwide are calling on governments to boost resources for studying rare
diseases and treating patients.
They say patients are mostly abandoned by local
governments and pharmaceutical companies which deem it not  cost-effective to
pour resources into researching cures for diseases that afflict only a tiny
population.
There are more than 5,000 rare diseases listed in the world with new ones being
described every week in medical literature, and no available treatment for
between 4,000 and 5,000 of these afflictions.
According to the Pompe Community (www.pompe.com), Pompe disease is estimated to
affect about 1 in 40,000 live births.
Just like Pompe, many rare diseases are caused by gene mutations that affect the
production of enzymes which are necessary for specific chemical reactions in the
body, according to Professor Albert Li  Man-chim  from Chinese University's
department of paediatrics.
"The lack of enzymes leads to metabolic diseases," he explains.
Other children may get a rare disease from a hidden mutated  gene from either
the paternal or maternal side.
Sarah, a 13-month-old Danish baby, failed to receive active genes from a
specific section of her father's chromosome 15 and was diagnosed with
Prader-Willi syndrome last December at Queen Mary Hospital.
While Kei Kei and Sarah have had their rare conditions diagnosed, the difficulty
of getting a diagnosis in Hong Kong creates much anguish for parents, says
Christina Hellmann, chairman of the Joshua Hellmann Foundation for Orphan
Diseases  which provides support to rare disease sufferers under the age of 19.
Hellmann set up the foundation  in 2007 after her son Joshua died at the age of
15 from the rare  neuro-degenerative disease Melas syndrome.
The foundation has
paid  for the diagnosis of 42 children with  rare diseases so far - and has
thereby helped the children receive the appropriate treatment.
Three of her children have
suffered from mitochondrial disease type five.
Her youngest son, Cheuk-ki,
seven, was diagnosed last year with the disease.
With an incidence rate of 1 in 5,000, it is estimated that there are at least
1,400 sufferers of mitochondrial disease in Hong Kong.
Defects in mitochondrial DNA
can cause poor growth, muscle weakness, visual and hearing problems, learning
disabilities, heart, liver and kidney disease, neurological problems and
dementia.
Their condition  just kept
deteriorating."
In 2010, the foundation arranged  for a sample of Cheuk-ki's muscle  cells to be
sent to Holland, and the results confirmed the disease.
Even when treatments are available, they may be too costly.
Expensive enzyme
replacement therapies are usually used for rare metabolic disorders, says
Stephen Ma On-tat, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) &
Rare Genetic Diseases Mutual Aid Group.
Ma, whose 19-year-old son suffers from MPS type
six, says the enzyme therapy treatment, which became available in 2004, costs
more than HK$4 million per year.
Members of the mutual aid group took to the streets in 2007 to fight for the
treatment's inclusion in the Hospital Authority's Drug Formulary.
The government responded by setting up an expert panel on rare metabolic
diseases in 2007, which reviews rare disease cases and decides whether they
warrant subsidised treatment.
So far, the panel has only reviewed four diseases: Pompe, MPS, Fabry  and
Gaucher's.
The Hospital Authority says the panel will continue to assess applications from
patients with MPS.
"We will consider whether to provide individual patients with
subsidised treatment.
Meanwhile, the Hospital Authority will provide timely
support to patients according to their condition and medical needs."

Canada's largest Aspirin manufacturer will soon begin to label Aspirin
 with a warning that children taking the drug for flu or chicken pox may
 face an increased risk of Reye's Syndrome, a rare disease that kills one
 in four of its victims.
Co., manufacturers of Bayer Aspirin, made the
 decision after a recent U.S. study linking Aspirin with Reye's Syndrome
 prompted Washington to require U.S. drug manufacturers to put warning
 labels on Aspirin.
Reye's Syndrome is a degenerative disease of children and teen-agers
 that often follows severe viral infections, affecting internal organs and
 the brain.

Feb. 13--TIFTON -- The South Health District announced Tuesday that within the
last three months two children in Tift County have contracted a rare disease
called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
The disease, which affects the kidneys,
is usually associated with a powerful toxin produced by certain strains of
bacteria, usually E. coli O157:H7.
It is a potentially deadly condition that is
the leading cause of acute kidney failure in infants and young children.
Good hygiene and hand washing with
warm water and soap are the best defense against person-to-person spread of the
disease, Feldman said.

Mrs Bowyer's son, Riley, suffers from a rare auto-inflammatory disease called
Periodic Fever Syndrome for which there is no cure.
''As February 28 is Rare Disease Day I decided I wanted to run a campaign which
acknowledges and raises awareness of all the children and families out there
battling many forms of rare disease, not just Riley's condition,'' she said.

Orphan diseases that fail to get much attention

Mitochondrial disease is one of the orphan diseases - an ailment that has been
ignored by the medical and pharmaceutical industries because of its rarity.
Governments also allocate little resources to patients with rare diseases as can
be seen in the lack of funding for equipment to diagnose mitochondrial disease
in Hong Kong.
"Are the lives of rare disease patients less valuable than those with common
diseases?"
said Christina Hellmann, chairman of the Joshua Hellmann Foundation
for Orphan Disease which advocates the rights of rare disease patients.
She set up the foundation in memory of her son, Joshua, who died at 15 in 2007
of a mitochondrial disease called Melas Syndrome, which affects the brain,
nervous system and muscles.
The foundation funds tests for suspected cases and has a network of experts
providing support to patients and families.
There are between 6,000 and 8,000 types of rare diseases in the world.
In Hong Kong, there is not enough information on the prevalence of rare diseases
to generate meaningful estimates.
The term "rare disease" is defined differently from country to country.
In general, a disease is considered rare if it affects up to one in 2,000
people.

Diagnosis problems for those with rare diseases

BYLINE: Lauren Turner

LENGTH: 160 words



HIGHLIGHT: Nearly half of people with rare diseases are initially misdiagnosed,
a survey has found.
The report by Rare Disease UK (RDUK) found that almost 20 per cent of sufferers
lived with their conditions for more than five years before they received an
accurate diagnosis and over 10 per cent had to wait more than a decade.
Rare diseases are classified as those which affect one in 2,000 people.
RDUK
says such conditions are "surprisingly common", with 3.5 million people in the
UK experiencing one at some point in their lives.
Conditions include all childhood cancers, muscular dystrophy and Cockayne
syndrome, characterised by poor growth and premature ageing.
Alastair Kent, chairman of RDUK, said: "Not only is it often a battle to get an
accurate diagnosis, patients and families then struggle to find out the medical
impact of a condition and how to manage it, on top of having to cope with
day-to-day life without adequate support."

CHILDREN born by in-vitro fertilisation are about five times more likely to
develop a rare genetic growth disorder, an Australian study has found.
It was based on a sample of 37 babies born in Victoria between 1983 and 2003,
all of whom were diagnosed with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, a rare disease that
causes babies to overgrow.
The study found that the syndrome affected one in 400 children born through IVF.
Other research has found the general prevalence of the syndrome ranges from one
in 35,000 to one in 15,000.
The syndrome is not life-threatening.

April 10--WAPAKONETA -- A pair of benefits for the family of a 10-year-old girl
who is battling an incurable disease will be held during the next two weeks.
Mara Moon, a fourth-grader at Wapakoneta Elementary School, has been afflicted
with a mitochondrial disease since she was 3 years old.
When she was 5, Mara was diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome, a rare disease
that affects just 2 percent of school-age children.
The disease causes repeated
attacks of severe nausea, vomiting and physical exhaustion that occur with no
apparent cause.
During Easter weekend, Mara's aunts and uncles decided to organize a benefit for
their family to help curb the cost of her treatment.
While Mara has struggled with the disease for years, her grandmother, Kathy
Wallace, said her granddaughter is in good spirits.

A rare disease that can cause blindness in young boys could be cured if more
money was donated for research, a charity said today.
The charity, backed by Jonathan Ross, is the main organisation raising money for
work into Lowe Syndrome, a genetic condition that causes physical and mental
problems.
Lorraine Thomas set up the Lowe Syndrome Trust 10 years ago after her
son was diagnosed with the disease.
Support: BBC presenter Jonathan Ross is a trustee of the Lowe Syndrome Trust

In Karan Johar's latest film My Name is Khan, Shah Rukh Khan suffers from a rare
disease called Asperger syndrome.
This syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder
and affects a person's behaviour and perception.
Hans
discovered this disease in 1944.
Symptoms
of Asperger syndrome include being an introvert, repetitive behaviour and
reluctance to listen.
Some of the famous people like Adolf Hitler, Jane Austen and Leonardo da Vinci
are speculated to be suffering from this disease.
"These cases are as rare as
Auro's in Paa," Barve adds.
There is no drug that can cure this syndrome, but a lot of research is taking
place towards the right direction.

Province to fund medication for child with rare disease

SECTION: INTERNATIONAL; Pg.
On the other end of the line was Health Minister Victor Boudreau, who told the
Baie-Sainte-Anne family that government will fund the first year of 10-year-old
Morgan Doucet's treatment for a rare disease called Morquio Syndrome.
People with Morquio Syndrome are missing an enzyme in their blood responsible
for breaking down cellular waste in the body.
Without it, waste builds up in
bones, tissues, organs and muscles, causing heart and airway disease, stiffening
in the joints, shortened stature, and in some cases, premature death.
Morgan is
believed to be the only person in the province with type A of the disease.
It will be part of a treatment plan approved by Morgan's geneticist at the IWK
Children's Hospital in Halifax.
"New Brunswick will continue to collaborate with other provinces and territories
on a consistent, national approach to review expensive drugs for rare diseases,"
Boudreau said.

Rare genetic disease affecting Arab children discovered by researchers at Sheba
Medical Center

BYLINE: JUDY SIEGEL

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

LENGTH: 754 words


A rare genetic disease that weakens the immune system of children has been
discovered among Arab children by an international group of researchers headed
by Israelis at Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer.
Information on the discovery of the "orphan disease" (suffered by a relatively
small group) was published Thursday morning in the prestigious New England
Journal of Medicine.
What began as a clinical observation of a unique phenotype in sick patients has
finally been concluded by using advanced genetic and molecular assays to
discover the novel disease, said Dr. Raz Somech at the Safra Children's Hospital
at Sheba.
They observed that the seven affected children suffered from life-threatening
infections during the first two years of their lives; their research led to the
discovery of an unusual bone marrow malfunction due to mutations in a gene named
VPS45 (Vacuolar Protein Sorting 45) as the cause of the disease, which they
called congenital neutrophil defect syndrome.
No Jews have been identified with the syndrome, but Somech said that "now we
will be able to look.
It is a rare disease, but because of consanguinity in this
region, we are likely to see many more cases than in other countries."
If the victims of the disease were Jewish children, it is likely that they could
be successfully treated, as there are hundreds of thousands of Jews who undergo
voluntary tissue testing so a compatible donor could be found, he added.
The Sheba team are now considering a different - biological - treatment that
could prevent the need for bone marrow transplantation for the children who lack
a healthy gene.
Children with orphan diseases are at a disadvantage in many ways.
They are taken
from one doctor to the next in the hope of a treatment or cure being found.
In
addition, drug companies are very reluctant to invest huge sums to develop
treatments when only a small number of patients are involved.
However, genetic research can identify such diseases, and such work can
contribute to the advancement of modern medicine, because the examination of
these children can supply insights into fundamental principles of biology.
"On the one hand, the identification of this disease and the discovery of its
molecular mechanism creates a justified hope for affected patients, as young
patients can now receive blood stem cell transplantation earlier" if suitable
donors were available.
On the other hand, this research illustrates the importance of new signalling
pathways that can possibly influence the therapy of the future - not only for
children with rare diseases, but also for younger and older patients with common
diseases.
The center serves patients from the whole Middle East region, including the
Palestinian Authority and runs a collaboration with Palestinian doctors.
The
purpose of the center is to better diagnose, treat and cure patients suffering
from primary immunodeficiency and to characterize and understand the immune
system both healthy and diseased, Somech said.

Global Cushing's Syndrome Therapeutics Market 2015-2019: Key Vendors - Corcept
Therapeutics, HRA Pharma, Novartis

LENGTH: 369  words


Nov. 20 -- Ireland-based Research and Markets issued the following news release:

Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Cushing's
Syndrome Therapeutics Market 2015-2019" report to their offering.
One major trend upcoming in this market is the increase in public awareness of
Cushing's syndrome.
This is expected to lead to an increase in the number of
treatment-seeking patients, thereby giving rise to the consumption of
medications.
According to the report, the major driving factor of the market is the presence
of a huge unmet need in this rare disease area.
Further, the report states that the adverse effects of the drugs used to treat
Cushing's syndrome are a major challenge to the growth of the market.
Patient
incompatibility leads to an increase in the churn-out rate of the patients from
the treatment.

HIGHLIGHT: Conference will look at syndrome that occurs in roughly 1 in 10,000
births.
Traci Weber has never met anyone who suffers from the same rare genetic disorder
as her 4-year-old son, who still fits into baby clothes and can't speak.
That will change next week when Weber, of Irvine, attends a national conference
for the Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Foundation in Costa Mesa.
Her son, Jacob, was
diagnosed a few days after birth with the condition, which is marked by traits
such as small size, thin eyebrows that meet in the middle, and thin, down-turned
lips.
Speakers include UC Irvine professors Arthur Lander and Anne Calof,
whose infant daughter died of the syndrome in 2000.
The syndrome occurs in roughly 1 in 10,000 births.
Children may suffer
intellectual disabilities, gastroesophageal reflux disease, bowel obstruction,
hearing loss and congenital heart defects.
Weber, 42, said she sometimes tells strangers he's a preemie because it's easier
than explaining a condition most people have never heard of.

A PATIENT has written a disturbing account of life with a condition which makes
him think he is dead - and how he spent his days in graveyards as it was "the
closest I could get to death".
Doctors diagnosed him with Cotard's Syndrome, also known as "walking corpse
syndrome" because it makes people think they have turned into zombies.
The unusual condition emerged after Graham, who suffered from severe depression,
tried to commit suicide by taking an electrical appliance with him into the
bath.
Only through months of therapy and treatment was he able to overcome the
condition and live anything approaching a normal life.
Cotard's Syndrome is
among the most rare diseases in the world and it is thought that it affects just
a few hundred people at any one time.
It was a waste of time
speaking as I never had anything to say'

ArQule Reports Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results

LENGTH: 1283  words


Nov. 7 -- ArQule, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARQL) today announced its financial results for
the third quarter of 2016.
* ARQ 092, our lead proprietary AKT inhibitor, continues to demonstrate the
potential utility of targeting AKT in rare non-oncological indications and will
be the focus of an oral presentation at the ASH Annual Meeting.
The data, to be
presented by The University of Illinois College of Medicine, demonstrate that in
neutrophils and platelets from Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients in vitro and
cell-cell interactions in a mouse model of SCD, ARQ 092 attenuates
neutrophil-platelet interactions.
* ARQ 092 phase 1 trial for Proteus syndrome continues to enroll and our
collaborator, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is in the final stages of
implementing an updated enrollment protocol that will facilitate logistics for
patients and their families.
* ARQ 092 clinical research to be expanded into PROS (PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth
Spectrum) family of rare diseases.
The company received approval of its IND
application from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the PROS family of
rare diseases, including Proteus syndrome, for a potential clinical trial.
"It is exciting to see our proprietary pipeline being pursued independently and
through collaborations with the top researchers in the fields of oncology,
hematology and selected rare diseases," said Paolo Pucci, Chief Executive
Officer of ArQule.
ARQ 092 continues to progress in Proteus syndrome through a
program that includes a phase 1 trial conducted by the NIH.

There's solace in numbers in the world of rare diseases

BYLINE: Morgan Morris

SECTION: NATIONAL

LENGTH: 1858 words



HIGHLIGHT: It's been a long journey of discovery for the family of a Cape Town
girl who suffers from cystinosis.>


In the world of rare diseases, the story of the Daniels family in Kraaifontein,
Cape Town, is probably typical.
For instance, it took parents Gail and Colin Daniels more than 11 years to put a
name to the condition -- cystinosis -- that had dogged their daughter, Danielle,
since birth.
It is a disease that has stunted her growth, slowed her learning,
made her a fixture in doctors' offices and hospital wards and subjected her to a
rigid diet of supplements and boosters.
She suspected that her child had rickets, a
disease, common in Africa, that is characterised by the softening of what are
meant to be growing bones.
Narrowing down the condition But after months of tests, mad dashes to the
hospital, a string of specialists and a babble of misdiagnoses, doctors finally
narrowed down her condition to Fanconi syndrome.
Named after a Swiss paediatrician, the syndrome affects the ducts or tubes
leading from the kidney.
But in this syndrome the ducts are
unable to do so and precious glucose, carbohydrates, phosphates, amino acids and
minerals are passed out in the urine.
There is no cure for Fanconi syndrome.
Instead, patients are put on a lifelong
course of boosters, supplements, vitamins, phosphate replacements and citrates
to make up for the shortfall of minerals.
Also patients are commonly lethargic, so learning is slow.
Naming the disease Cystinosis borrows its name from a namesake gene, the
cystinosis gene.
Both parents,
unaffected by the condition, have to carry the faulty CTNS gene.
A childhood disease, cystinosis is considered rare.
"A lot of children probably die from this condition without it being diagnosed,
especially in the developing world," said Dr Peter Nourse, the paediatric
nephrologist at Cape Town's Red Cross Children's Hospital who treats Danielle.
With about 14 patients at Cape Town's Red Cross and Tygerberg hospitals, Nourse
has good reason to think that the disease is more common than statistics bear
out.
Treatment Although there is no cure for cystinosis, there is a treatment in a
drug called cysteamine.
Cystagon was developed as an orphan drug -- medication for rare diseases -- in
the United States, where it has been prescribed for cystinosis for the past 15
years.
Raptor
Pharmaceuticals in the US is making headway on a delayed-release version of the
treatment, to be known as DR Cysteamine.
After all, the markets for treatments for most rare diseases are usually too
small to coax companies to do the necessary R&D.
"Funding for rare diseases is very uneven," points out cystinosis guru Dr
William A Gahl, clinical director at the National Human Genome Research
Institute in Maryland in the US.
But the condition piqued academic interest because of its "intriguing basis" as
a lysosomal transport defect, says Gahl.
Researchers hope that treatments for a
few dozen inherited metabolic disorders, also linked to faulty lysosomes, can be
developed on the back of cystinosis studies.
"By
doing so, we'll have a more thorough picture of cystinosis and its
complications, providing our research teams with information they so desperately
need to discover novel treatments and a cure."
Gail is mother hen to others in the South African group, largely state patients
with no medical aid.
"There is a treatment for cystinosis," says Hobbs-Hotz.
"We want the medical
community to understand the disease so they can make a proper diagnosis and for
families to understand the disease and the need for compliance."

Heart experts at Italy's University of Pavia found between 25 per cent and 30
per cent of such deaths were caused by a rare disease called long-QT syndrome,
an electrical abnormality in the heart.
The condition affects about one person
in 10,000 in the West and is caused by genetic mutations.
Dr Cheung Pik-to, an associate professor in Hong Kong University's department of
paediatrics, said genetic factors could account for the low number of cases of
sudden infant death syndrome in Hong Kong.
"We expect to learn more about the genetic basis of
QT-syndrome with the completion of the human genome project."
Dr Cheung said international figures on sudden infant death syndrome - also
called cot death - showed Hong Kong had 0.2 deaths in 1,000 babies, compared
with 0.7 in Britain, 1.4 in New Zealand and 0.8 in the US.

Mother's plea to NHS to fund drug for Sam, 6

LENGTH: 588  words


A mother has issued a heartfelt plea to NHS chiefs to fund a new treatment for
an incurable degenerative condition which is her son's only hope of a better
life.
Sam Brown, six, was born with the very rare Morquio syndrome, which prevents
children growing normally.
Since 2012, his family have been given fresh hope in a trial of a new drug
Vimizim, which they say has led to significant improvements in his condition,
which affects fewer than 100 people in the UK.
The youngster is continuing to
receive the treatment until a meeting of health officials next month to decide
if it should be funded from the public purse.
But she added: "Every indication we have been given thus far is that the funding
will not be approved, which means his treatment would stop and the disease would
be allowed to progress.
She said a scorecard used by NHS England to appraise drugs discriminated against
very rare diseases where treatments tend to be expensive.
"He has no idea of the silent path Morquio syndrome has set for his future.
Christine Lavery, chief executive of the Society for Mucopolysaccharide
Diseases, blamed changes under the Government's NHS reforms last year for
causing uncertainty for people over funding for new treatments.
Morquio syndrome affects major organs, leading to physical disability, shortness
including a maximum height of 3.5ft, heart disease and difficulties breathing.
A petition calling on NHS England to fund the drug is at
http://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/nhs-england-s-scorecard-discriminates-agai
nst-treating-ultra-rare-diseases&urlHash=1.6169192254645206E-271.
A regional spokesman for NHS England said: "We sympathise with any patient and
family who await a decision on the authorisation of a drug or treatment and
appreciate what a difficult time this must be.
Decisions to fund treatments and
drugs are made based on their effectiveness following clinical trials."

DATELINE: New Delhi


Arian Chowdhury can finally heave a sigh of relief.
The 12-year-old boy from
Kolkata who was diagnosed with a rare lysosomal storage disorder called Hunter
Syndrome at the age of 4, will finally receive treatment free of cost.
American drug manufacturer Shire that produces Elaprase, the only drug to treat
this condition, has agreed to provide treatment to the boy free of cost for the
rest of his life.
Since the medicine is expensive, many patients are left without
treatment.
Shire agreed to fund Arian's treatment under its Charitable Access Program
(CAP), where it selects patients from across the world diagnosed with various
rare diseases such as Gaucher, Fabry and MPS II (Hunter Syndrome).
While there are others from India who have been selected as part of CAP, the
exact number of patients is not known.
Shire responded saying a "significant
number of patients" had been selected for this.
A subsequent meeting with Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan promising to
offer Arian help, gave a boost to his chances of getting treatment.
"In March when we visited our doctor in Delhi
she applied for his treatment.
All about The disease

What is it:  A rare genetic disease that interferes with the way cells and
organs function in the body.
Only seen in males, the disease affects one in
5,000 people.
Most other rare diseases affect one in 2,000.
Named after Scottish
physician Charles A Hunter in 1917, there are an estimated 120 patients
suffering from the  disease in India.
Treatment: Apart from palliative care, there is a drug Elaprase, developed by US
drug manufacturer Shire Human Genetic Therapies Ltd, which is the only known
drug to effectively treat patients suffering from this syndrome.

Anavex Announces US FDA Orphan Drug Designation for ANAVEX 2-73 for Treatment of
Infantile Spasms

LENGTH: 454  words


June 22 -- Anavex Life Sciences Corp. ("Anavex" or the "Company") (Nasdaq:AVXL),
a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing differentiated
therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental
diseases including Alzheimer's disease, other central nervous system (CNS)
diseases, pain and various types of cancer, today reports the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's Office of Orphan Product Development has granted Orphan Drug
Designation to ANAVEX 2-73 for the treatment of infantile spasms.
"Infantile spasms marks the second Orphan Drug Designation for our ANAVEX 2-73
program, following the Orphan Drug Designation received for the treatment of
Rett syndrome," said Kristina M. Capiak, Vice President of Regulatory Affairs
for Anavex.
The FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development advances the evaluation of drugs
that show promise for the safe treatment of rare diseases, defined as those
affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.
About Infantile Spasms

An infantile spasm is a specific type of seizure seen in an epilepsy syndrome of
infancy and childhood known as West Syndrome.
West Syndrome is characterized by
infantile spasms, developmental regression, and a specific pattern on
electroencephalography (EEG) testing called hypsarrhythmia (chaotic brain
waves).
Neurological and/or developmental outcomes in patients with
infantile spasms are usually poor.
Physician says 16th president suffered rare genetic
cancer

BYLINE: By Lisa M. Krieger< San Jose Mercury News<Summary goes here.
That's the controversial conclusion reached by physician and amateur historian
John Sotos, who says President Lincoln was suffering from a lethal genetic
cancer syndrome when he was shot at Ford's Theatre 143 years ago.
"Lincoln was a rare man with a rare disease," said Dr. Sotos.
In 1962, it was suggested that
his great height and long limbs were linked to a genetic disorder called Marfan
syndrome.
Others have proposed alternate ailments - Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
perhaps, or Stickler syndrome.
The
condition, which causes aggressive thyroid cancer, explains Lincoln's lanky
build, chronic constipation, hooded eyes, asymmetric jaw and the lumps on his
lips, he said.
More skeptical is Dr. Jeffrey F. Moley, an expert in the disease at Washington
University in St. Louis.

Health: Support group to meet;
Cushing's syndrome sufferers work together

BYLINE: Augie Frost, Staff Writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.
Farrar is one of 3,000 to 4,500 Americans who have Cushing's syndrome, a rare
hormonal disorder, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases.
The Cushing's Understanding Support & Help group -- of which Farrar is vice
president -- will hold a conference Thursday and Friday to support patients and
"bring about awareness of this rare disease," Farrar said.
The syndrome is named for Dr. Harvey Cushing, who
discovered it in the early 1900s.
The syndrome typically affects adults age 20
to 50 and is caused by higher than normal levels of cortisol, a hormone produced
by the adrenal glands that help manage the body's metabolism and stress levels.

Montreal firm developing drug for deadly E. coli complication; Bellus Health
estimates 3,000 yearly cases of potentially fatal syndrome

BYLINE: Damon Van Der Linde, Financial Post

SECTION: FINANCIAL POST; Pg.
While Chipotle works to reassure customers that its food is safe, Montreal
drugmaker, Bellus Health Inc., is the only company in the world developing a
treatment for a sometimes fatal complication to the bacteria and will be taking
the treatment to the FDA to begin U.S. studies next year.
In five to 10 per cent of cases of E. coli the Shiga toxin is produced which
causes hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which affects the kidneys, often leading
to the need for dialysis, and in certain cases chronic renal disease and death,
primarily in children under five.
It's both a rare disease product, which
is an area that we strongly believe in developing drugs for, there's a very high
unmet medical need there and there's also a good potential for a strong return
for our shareholders," said Bellus CEO Roberto Bellini.
Before then there was little progress
being made to develop any sort of treatment for this severe complication.
"We're focused on developing drugs for rare diseases and don't want to do
research or stuffthat's too early stage because we don't think that's a good use
of our money and our time," Bellini said.
Health-care equity research analyst
David Martin said there has been a rise in developing treatments for rare
diseases because a lot of the low-hanging fruit in medicine has been picked by
the big pharma companies who commercialize treatments for the most common
illnesses.
"It's looking at these rare diseases where you can actually make an impact in
medicine and the value of what you're developing," said Martin.
Also, because a
lot of the "blockbuster" drugs that came out in the past three decades have gone
off patent it's created room to pay for drugs for rare, serious diseases.
"There's more of a need for companies developing drugs for rare, currently
untreated, diseases than there is for just about any other area of medicine
right now," Martin said.
To make a significant profit, treatments for rare diseases typically don't come
cheap.
Bellus' flagship product, Kiacta, which is used for treating another rare kidney
disease, will be on its way to gaining regulatory approval by the middle of next
year and has been modelled by Zacks Small Cap Research to be priced at an
estimated $200,000 per year in the U.S. "I think it's accepted that it just
costs so much to develop drugs these days and if you've got 10 million people
who take your drug it's pretty easy to recoup your cost, but when you've got
5,000 people who take your drug it's got to be priced high," Martin said.
Montreal drugmaker Bellus Health Inc.,is
developing the world's only treatment for a sometimes fatal complication to E.
Scotty has Hunter syndrome and has been incredibly active on the #Path2Cures.
The Mayo Clinic describes hunter syndrome as "a very rare, inherited genetic
disorder caused by a missing or malfunctioning enzyme.
Rep. Denham has helped raise awareness of Hunter syndrome, Scotty's own story,
and 21st Century Cures - most noticeably on Scotty's birthday each year.Today,
those efforts continue with a Facebook Live event discussing how 21st Century
Cures will help the rare disease community.
Scotty's uncle had Hunter syndrome
and passed away at the age of 12.
Today at 19, Scotty is hoping #CuresNow will
help find more treatments - or even a cure - to extend his life.
But of broader importance to modern medicine -- and to one Utah family --
researchers also zeroed in on the genetic causes of two rare diseases,
trailblazing the quest to identify more complex and common genetic disorders.
"Just a few years ago if you had asked me, or other geneticists, we wouldn't
have been so sanguine about being able to identify these rare diseases," said
physician Jared Roach, senior research scientist at the Seattle-based Institute
for Systems Biology, which led the study.
The Madsen children are among only 30 people worldwide who have been diagnosed
with Miller's syndrome, a condition characterized by facial and limb
malformations.
Theirs was the first reported family to have two children
affected by the syndrome.
They also inherited Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), a rare condition in which
the tiny hair-like structures that are supposed to remove mucus from the lungs
don't work.
The odds of having both PCD and Miller's syndrome are less than one in 10
billion, which made the family the perfect test case for new family sequencing
technology.
So the research team
needed to find children who had inherited a recessive disorder from parents who
showed no genetic abnormalities -- the rarer the better.
"Until now we didn't know what caused [Miller's syndrome].
The one tied to Miller's
syndrome, "DHOHD," is a metabolic building block, which means it's possible the
disease could be treated nutritionally, said Roach.
Logan, 29, relieved to learn from researchers that it's unlikely he would pass
along either PCD or Miller's syndrome to children.

About OrbeShield

OrbeShield is formulated for oral administration in GI ARS patients as a single
product consisting of two tablets.
BDP has been marketed in the US and worldwide since
the early 1970s as the active pharmaceutical ingredient in inhalation products
for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma.
OrbeShield also is being developed for use in other GI disorders
characterized by severe inflammation such as pediatric Crohn's disease and
radiation enteritis.
Although hematopoietic ARS can be
rescued by bone marrow transplantation or growth factor administration, there is
no established treatment or preventive measure for the GI damage that occurs
after high-dose radiation.

However, Piermatteo's case was rare.
Dr. Diane Kepner of White Rose Family Practice said most patients do not have
the condition as severe as Piermatteo did.
Doctors gave Piermatteo intravenous immunoglobulin treatments that worked
temporarily, but his paralysis continued to worsen.
Next, they tried
plasmapheresis, a blood purification procedure used to treat several autoimmune
diseases.
While some patients regain
their strength in months, 30 percent of them experience weakness for up to three
years.

Chet Culver and several other U.S. governors have proclaimed Feb. 28
as "Rare Disease Day."
In the U.S. a disease is considered "rare" if it affects
fewer than 200,000 people.
It is estimated that approximately 30 million
Americans (one in 10) have a rare disease.
Unfortunately, research for most rare
diseases is lacking in funding, which leaves people with little to no chance of
being cured.
Physicians are oftentimes unfamiliar with the disease, leaving
their patients without an accurate diagnosis, which can result in unnecessary
medical testing.
These obstacles leave a person with a rare disease feeling
isolated.
It is the goal
of the National Organization for Rare Diseases to make the last day of February
"Rare Disease Day" every year in the United States, Australia, Canada, China,
throughout Europe and elsewhere.
I hope readers will visit
www.rarediseaseday.org to learn more about the worldwide activities taking place
Feb. 28.
Most people worry about the big killers such as
heart disease and cancer but rare diseases do not cause much worry because the
odds against contracting them can be as low as one in a million.
However there
is an awesome number of diseases trying homo sapiens; the World Health
Authority's International Classification of Disease runs to about 1,000 pages,
with 20 to 30 entries a page.
In other words, most disease is rare, though any
comfort you derive from this may quickly turn to alarm if you draw an unlucky
number in the health lottery.
Rare disease, often hard to diagnose, afflicts
tens of thousands of Britons each year.
Thanks to a knowledgeable and quick-thinking GP her disease was
diagnosed quickly and efficiently and she has made a full recovery.
Stern
developed Guillain Barre Syndrome which affects one in every 50,000 people.
"It's not routinely taught in medical school and it can be difficult for a
doctor to recognise the symptoms," says Glennys Sanders, founder of the Guillain
Barre Syndrome Support Group.
Behet's Syndrome, an immune disorder of the blood vessels, is even rarer,
affecting one in every 100,000 people.
"Some doctors don't appear to believe
patients when they describe their symptoms," says Georgina Seaman, of the
Behet's Syndrome Society.
"This can lead to years of delay in people getting
appropriate help and treatment.
We cannot blame doctors for "missing" really rare disease like Behet's Syndrome,
but how can we ensure that we make the most of available information?
After many tests, a
young doctor said: "It's probably Guillain Barre Syndrome.
I should have realised something serious was happening
when they started checking my breathing every 30 minutes; and when the nurses
reassured me that all their Guillain Barre patients had "made a complete
recovery".
During my five-week stay in hospital I discovered that the syndrome had been
discovered in 1916 by two French doctors, after whom it is named.
It is an
auto-immune disease in which the body turns upon itself.

remarks of the male heart patients (this was a mixed cardiac ward) - "Here comes
Nigel Mansell.
The physiotherapists worked from the
"neurogym" where all the neurologically-impaired patients went once or twice a
day.

WHITTIER - Single mom June Lipps was completely frustrated and felt alone in her
quest to get a definitive diagnosis for her son.
Dylan Lipps was diagnosed with Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome
(Glut1-DS), a rare brain disease.
A rare (or orphan) disease is generally considered to have a prevalence of fewer
than 200,000 affected individuals in the United States, according to the
National Institutes of Health's office of rare disease research.
Lipps is leading a campaign to honor her son on Wednesday, which is Rare Disease
Day.
Wednesday marks the fifth international Rare Disease Day coordinated by EURORDIS
(Rare Diseases Europe) and organized with rare disease national alliances in
more than 40 countries worldwide.
"Solidarity," the day's 2012 theme, focuses on the importance and the need for
collaboration as well as mutual support in the field of rare diseases.
It was a relief to put a name to Dylan's condition, but with it came a whole new
set of obstacles.
"The only treatments are the ketogenic diet
or the Modified Atkins Diet with MCT oil (medium chain triglycerides) that my
son is on."."
Having Glut1-DS means that an affected child's cells do not pick up protein that
transports glucose to the brain - it does not work properly in Glut1-DS
patients.

Albany Med to Host 'World Rare Diseases' Forum

LENGTH: 220  words


New Delhi, March 1 -- In recognition of the 6th annual World Rare Diseases Day,
Albany Medical Center, in cooperation with the Global Genes Project, the Oley
Foundation and local organizer Ed Fennell, will present a World Rare Diseases
forum on Thursday, February 28 from 4pm to 6pm at the Hilton Garden Inn at
Albany Medical Center.
In the United States, a disease is considered rare when it affects fewer than
200,000 people nationwide.
The National Institutes of Health estimates there are
nearly 7,000 known rare diseases in the world affecting approximately 300
million people; more than AIDS and cancer combined.
It's estimated that 80
percent of those diseases affect children.
Doctors from Albany Med's pediatric infectious disease division will discuss and
take questions about treatment of rare diseases.
They will be joined by a
patient who, because of a rare disease called short bowel syndrome, has been on
intravenous (IV) feedings for the last 30 years, and a representative from the
Oley Foundation, an organization that supports patients who require long-term IV
feedings.
The forum will be moderated by Fennell, the grandfather of two children who are
battling rare diseases.
It will include a question and answer session as well as
time for families who are affected by rare diseases to share their stories.

Rare disease conference

IMAGINE this - your child has been diagnosed with a rare genetic disease.
There is no specific treatment.
Its cause is unknown, indeed, not much is known about the disease at all.
Such a scenario faced David Stevens when his daughter, Deisha, was diagnosed
with Rubinstein-Tabyi syndrome about two years ago.
The disease is characterised by broad thumbs and toes, short stature,
distinctive facial features and varying degrees of mental disability.
He could find only nine other families in Australia with children having the
syndrome.
Having established the Rubinstein-Taybi Australia Association, now with 40
registered families, set up its website and Facebook page, this weekend Mr
Stevens is convening the inaugural Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome Australian
Conference at Darlington Beach Resort at Arrawarra.
"This is the first time that families with the disease have had the opportunity
to get together," Mr Stevens said.
The first phase
of the program used four U.S. Census regions located in seven states as the test
sites and employed a rubric of costs incurred for home healthcare patients who
migrated to other settings, including in-patient hospital and nursing and
rehabilitative care as well as hospice care and use of durable medical equipment
to determine scores.
NIH pins down rare disease gene

Finding specific genetic components responsible for propensity to a commonly
encountered disease is tricky enough, but figuring out which gene sequences are
implicated in rare diseases is an entirely different matter.
In a May 6 announcement, NIH says that it has used "inexpensive, high-speed
sequencing and a newly developed ability to capture pieces of the genome that
encode genes" to diagnose "an extremely rare X chromosome-linked cleft palate
syndrome known to affect just two families" in the U.S. Best of all, NIH
indicates that the effort might speed along efforts to pin down the genetic
components of other rare diseases.
The disease in question, bearing the unfortunate acronym of TARP (Talipes
equinovarus, Atrial septal defect, Robin sequence, Persistent left superior vena
cava), is said to be caused by a mutation in a gene known as the RNA binding
motif 10 (RBM10) gene.
Using samples from the original family as well as a second family recently known
to be affected by the syndrome allowed NIH researchers to pin down the precise
location of the damaged genetic material.
Since the damaged gene appears in only
the X chromosome, fetal males are entirely susceptible to the syndrome because
they have no redundancy of the X chromosome to overwrite the faulty DNA.
The suite of other diseases implicated in other damage specific to the X
chromosome includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, color blindness and hemophilia
as well as "numerous forms of mental retardation," the statement notes.
James Mullikin, PhD, acting director of the NIH Sequencing Center in NIH's
facility in Rockville, Maryland and a co-author of the study, is quoted in the
announcement as saying that "further studies of the RBM10 gene may give
researchers further insight into more common forms of cleft palate," and that
studies of genes of rare disease states, "both those we already know something
about and the one-third of genes in the human genome we don't yet, can lead to a
better understanding of their larger biological function and role in other human
diseases."
